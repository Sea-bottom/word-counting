highly intelligent dangerously powerful the unchallenged sovereign of Earth's oceans they are the orca killer whales and their complex societies extend back into antiquity but does our modern society now threaten theirs joint jean-michel cousteau and his team as they investigate humankind's mirror in the water and discover that the orcas fight for survival is in fact now our own its jean-michel cousteau ocean tech ventures [Music] Eve she was a wonderful well when I was first out here I had no VHF radio had no radar I even have a compass and once became and lost in the fog I felt like I was in a glass of milk you just can't see anything and I could hear on the hydrophone this big cruise ship headed for me anyway Eve and her family the next 20 minutes came up so close to my boat that I was constantly switching the engine into neutral because I didn't want to hit them and after a few minutes I could just barely see something in oh was an island and I popped out and I was into the glorious sunset and in the clear and I kept waiting for Eve's family to come out of the fog but they never did and that was for me it was like worlds colliding trying to figure out what had gone on that she had turned around that she stayed by my boat and then when the I was safe she turned around again and at that moment I believed all the stories about dolphins pushing sailors to shore I don't know what it is about these whales but they do things like that in every one studying these whales sees the same thing they are our counterparts in the seat with the most complex marine species on the planet Orca the ruler of the ocean male orcas can be 9 tonnes 32 feet long with a towering dorsal fin 6 feet tall the crown with a smaller curved fit it made me the females that rule the pod they are the most widely distributed marine mammal in the world their realm extends from the Arctic to the Antarctic largest of the dolphins orcas also called killer whales number fewer than a hundred thousand worldwide and finding them take John Michell Cousteau and his team across the globe accompanied at times by his son Fabian and daughter Celine the cousteau team will journey to both the northern and Hemisphere's as they seek out killer whales in the Pacific Ocean the team will discover that people in orcas share surprising similarities even similar needs a fact made clear by their experiences with Keiko the world's most famous killer whale the team will also learn how some of the characteristics we consider strictly human-like language and culture may have also evolved among killer whales [Music] they'll travel among groups of workers that are as similar and as different as we are from each other [Music] their journey begins in the Pacific Northwest where orcas have been revered by native people for millennia studied by scientists for decades and where our story of the complicated relationship between orcas and people begins what we're trying to do is to make a connection between humans and nature comparing humans and orcas they are the dominant species in the ocean we are the dominant species on land and we all depend on the same thing [Music] the killer well the Orcas is such a powerful animal in terms of its appeal to people it captivates the imagination because we know that there are large dolphins and they are very intelligent they live in very social groups much like our own John Ford is a pioneer in Orca acoustics the first scientist identified dialects in their calls and to change our beliefs even though I've only been involved studying orcas for around 30 years things have changed so drastically in our attitude towards an incredible animal the attitude at that time was that these were dangerous animals a threat to people a threat to the livelihood of fishermen and I was caught up in that when I was young growing up on Vancouver Island here we'd go out fishing and a group of orcas would go by and we would be terrified if they swam under the boat because that was the feeling that these were dangerous animals on our Coast in the 1960s to mid-1970s there was a live capture fishery for orcas and they were sent to aquariums all over the world I actually got a job at the Vancouver Aquarium and soon became a whale trainer in the early 70s and got to know them in that context and they were fascinating animals of course and even then it was quite controversial holding them in captivity but I I realized we had so much to learn from them orcas have very large complex brains and when I first caught sight of an orca brain which was in a jar on a shelf and of that I was really quite amazed so the first question that came to me was what does this whale do with that brain still the question masky that was 40 years ago and you worked with some animals in captivity in 1967 behavioral research with an orca in SCARA at the Vancouver Aquarium and they wanted somebody to study the whale what did you learn from her mostly I think I learned that this was a very unsuitable place to keep a remarkable being that was around the time actually that dr. Michael big who died in 1990 and was very much our mentor and the true pioneer whose vision led to photo identification he started learning about the societies that these whales live in around our coast and that these were incredibly complex animals with very elaborate social relationships you put the brain and the implications of that together with the social side and you understand immediately that putting her in a concrete tank and completely shutting off the company of her kind was a enormous ly unfair and inappropriate things began but at the time it was through the close contact of captivity that we begin to learn about them one at a time the story of one whale in particular named Keiko stirred our passion and raised enduring questions about captivity Keiko was captured in 1979 in Iceland and became one of the 136 orc is taken into captivity since 1961 but he did not become one of the more than 100 that have died there one of the 42 killer whales that remain in captivity captured at age two and eventually sent to Mexico City Keiko was breathing the world's smallest air a master of the ocean at 7,000 feet above sea level in the artificial seawater of a shallow pool where he entertained the crowds CACO would have lived his life in poor health swimming in circles except for one thing he became a movie star as Willie he was free to 10,000,000 filmgoing children but in reality Keiko went nowhere the stress of his environment caused the skin disease which spread as his health seriously deteriorated the real whale was slowly dying and Keiko had to be moved when it was learned that Keiko was still captive millions of children wrote it demanding his freedom and a spontaneous movement was started to free the sick whale caicos owners donated him for the unprecedented experiment of reintroducing him into the wild and the Oregon Coast Aquarium customized the pool for his care suddenly the reality of free and Keiko became far more interesting than the movie as Keiko began a long and complicated journey toward freedom ultimately true freedom for Keiko would mean being accepted into a part of wild Wales since orcas lived their entire lives and tightly connected social groups we're all members are related to each other it's now understood the best chance for Keiko would be to find his mother it very much is a matriarchal society or matrilineal in that everybody in the group is related through female descent to a female ancestor individuals stay with their mother or their grandmother for the whole life and it took some years to really understand that because it is very unusual in that the large adult males never leave the group the bond between a mature male and his mother is very very strong I know that II the whale that came to you in the fog was a matriarch what happened when she passed away even Lee had two sons not--not daughters and those two males went around hanson island for weeks and didn't survive her death for very long generally the male's will join their sisters family but they they become a loose satellite they never again have the bond that they had with a mother it's a unique social system ork is a very conservative animal basically you only socialize with somebody who your mother introduced you to the resident populations on this coast are really very clearly divided socially into two different groups and northern residents is about 240 whales 16 pods the southern residents are around 90 whales 3 pods quite a bit smaller what's really interesting we don't really understand this but they never mix and then we have overlaying that transients the mammal hunters they don't mix with the residents but they will often mix with other transients and then occasionally we have these offshore whales and they don't mix with these others either so we have these whales that in many ways are just focused on they're very familiar neighboring groups that are up the same lifestyle it's a pattern strangely familiar much like human tribes existing near each other but separate with languages and behaviors learned and passed on over generations we define it as culture and for both humans and orcas different cultures exist among the same species [Music] and they both say that oh the New Zealand author I found are just so completely different from the Pacific Northwest I had this paradigm that that was how Orca were around the world that they had a maitre lineal society and state and very strongly bonded groups and that there was another population who fed on marine mammals well it turns out here that the New Zealand Orca are moving around between groups they feed on fish sharks rays and marine mammals acoustically they're different they have a good Kiwi twang just like I do and it looks like they're moving big distances compared to the animals up there I've got them traveling an average of a hundred to 150 kilometers a day and I think there's one of the things that fascinates me about Walker is the different cultures even though they're in similar habitats they're just so completely different Walker's have been stable in their social groups that we're looking at now for literally thousands of years if you look at the society and understand that this was evolved over a very long period of time he realized that you're looking at a successful society the wild party the challenge for him would be enormous since strong social bonds they actually define what it means to be in Orca at the time no one knew how to free a captive Orca it was a new frontier to trainers like Steve Clausen 14 years and Deshawn Michelle who became involved in the effort and who saw Keiko is a symbol of more than just one whale curator Nolan Harvey knew how far Keiko was from a wild Orca we're trying to teach Keiko to not only work for us within this pool so we can take better care of him but we need to let him become a killer well again we need on train him our goal all along has been to give him control of his life we're an active part of it especially since he is here by himself but the idea is to let him start making those decisions on what he wants to do when he wants to do it but previously anytime he did anything somebody asked for it even with vastly improved conditions Keiko continued to demonstrate his frustration from living in an artificial environment he expressed his stress in Mexico by knowing the concrete pool damaging his teeth and it continued an Oregon on his favorite rock a decision was made to cover it in order to discourage the behavior and to protect the teeth of the ocean's greatest predator in orcish sharp conical shaped teeth make feeding on large prey possible but Keiko primarily eats fish which orcas swallow whole so his damaged teeth should not be a problem in the wild when he arrived in Oregon Keiko was a thousand pounds underweight but soon doubled what he was eating in Mexico his waistline increased by three feet he gained nearly 2,000 pounds and grew eight inches longer [Music] but he still had to be taught to catch live fish as a milestone for his release and in order to survive in the wild accustomed to only dead fish at first he treated the live Neal like a toy surrounded by walls Keiko had never been observed using echolocation in captivity and to a wild killer whale it's a fundamental skill the whales hearing spectrum is many times ours their sensitivity is incredible they see with sound so when they're finding food they use their echolocation they make sounds they get echoes and they can turn that into a mental 3-dimensional image somewhere you know when you go into different places around the world and you look at look at what orcas are doing and understand that they sort of figured out how to live in the particular niche that they happen to have found it's really interesting looking at the differences as gray whales migrate earth occurs through Monterey California a part of transient orcas show why they're called wolves of the sea they hunt in packs to isolate then overpower a gray whale calf it's a predictable heart but as many as a third of the calves taken by orcas 20 to 30 whales may work together and share the bounty shirring seems to be really important in these groups that seems to be part of the way that the whales live together to avoid competition certainly they foots you when it comes to feeding on on larger animals but that's probably more offensive to the fact that these things that they're feeding on like whales are so big and there's not many of them in terms of they kill one then everybody has to feed on it female the best hunters will bring up a fish and others from her match line will come over and share that prey out what's kind of surprising for the residents they will share even a salmon that's perhaps only five ten pounds they will share that even though any whale in the group could easily swallow it has given us a new appreciation and insight into the workings of their society that said even though their dietary preference is culturally maintained and driven they don't seem to be really adaptable in the short term it might take a while before they can start focusing on alternative species I don't know the real traditionalist they only do it mom get me one mom eats and they socialize with the whales at mom socialize but they really don't like to branch out so if you have a habitat change and that particular prey is not there anymore then it's difficult for the Orca to a debt within decades and for a variety of reasons orcas throughout the world may be at the crossroads of adaptation or extinction as their prey diminishes something the resident whales of the Pacific Northwest now face it's a growing issue for the future but is similar to the question of whether Keiko would be able to adapt to hunting live fish in the wild without another whale to teach him Keiko initially seemed confused about the shift in his diet until finally either hunger or common sense kicked in and he began to catch a few live fish in the wild that wouldn't be enough using ultrasound to measure caicos fat layer or blubber the staff identified where it would show if he weren't eating enough in theory by measuring his blubber so easily in the wild from an extended pole scientists could know if and when they would have to intervene they did know that Keiko would have to be in better shape than he had ever been so even as 30 different toys were designed with a purpose filled with water a 200-pound ball became Caicos workout when he first arrived cake who could barely hold his breath for three and a half minutes he soon progressed to almost 18 normal for a wild killer whale but Keiko was still far from a wild whale which was vividly seen when at night he gathered his toys around him to sleep an array of cameras and hydrophones captured caicos movements and sounds taking advantage of this opportunity scientists carefully analyzes vocalizations trying to match them with specific behaviors hoping to take a step toward understanding killer whale communication CACO however had not communicated with another organ more than 20 years I'm studying a pair of whales called orky and Corky they would begin conversations with certain sounds and end conversations with certain sounds and I realized that studying communication between those two whales and captivity be like studying communication between two people in a prison that there was no way that I was going to actually learn what they were saying and the real context of their lives really the main thing about cookie and she's a survivor she has been in captivity for 38 years about 43 years old which is incredibly old for a captive walker most of them die within 10 years she still uses the cause of the FI pod and she is swimming it run run the tank and in a concrete tent if it sounds that they make reverberate off the walls of the tent they're there constantly but in an in an acoustic fuzz I think it's an incredibly stressful environment simply because of that and how is your research here at or collab different well when I was working in captivity and understood that if one wanted really to learn about them you needed to go into the wild and study them there at a distance and that's where we got into developing remote hydrophone systems that enable us to hear whales that we can't see we have a network of bridal toys cribs about 50 square kilometers of the area around us and we have speakers all over the place we're listening to all of them all of the time 24/7 365 but we're normally listening to a space and there are many voices in that space there's sort of general sense we understand when the wails of doing certain things we understand when they're chasing fish birds on because we're hearing every location once then when they're rested because they make this really sort of low-energy calls [Music] but we don't know who the voice has been altered so I think the really fascinating area to get into is a question but who is it as individuals are we listening to and if we can understand who's speaking maybe ultimately we might begin to understand what is being said I wanted to take all that I learned in captivity and apply it to wild wails and so I contacted a brilliant scientist in Canada dr. Mike big and I asked him do you know what family of whales or king Corky came from which sounds like an extraordinary request but you at the time was photographing each dorsal fin and saddle learning to tell them apart collecting all the pictures from the capture and there was a bunch of pictures that showed this whale we know call a 23 with little baby Corky just before she was taken from her mom so I had no boat experience I threw everything into a pickup truck and we pumped up the zodiac and Alert Bay and we went out there and I stopped and I put the hydrophones down put on the headsets and was her family calling and for the first time I heard these sounds in their natural environment just rolling on and rolling on and echoing and my first feeling was enormous guilt that it wasn't me I was there not Corky but that's how I felt one promising factor in caicos finding his family was that Orca calls can be heard 10 miles away there was hope for a dialect match among the North Atlantic orcas or Keiko would be reintroduced a hundred miles from where he was captured to prepare for his move a Bay Penn was constructed in the pristine Icelandic Bay finally the day arrived to return Keiko to the home he barely knew this had been Caicos unexpected journey to freedom then millions of children demanded but that no one knew exactly how to accomplish jean-michel had washed Caicos transformation for over two and a half years and had been witness to his devoted fans even the US air force had agreed to rent a c-17 cargo plane and crew for the trip announcing it was in the best interest of the nation to fly CACO home he was covered in ointment for the flight to protect his skin from drying after 15 anxious hours out of his element Keiko is at last returned to the cold ocean waters of his birth it was seen as the first step to restoring what had been taken away when he was captured CACO would first have to acclimate inside the confines of the bay pen [Music] month later his world expanded to the enclosed Bay or for the first time he ruled relative freedom it was Caicos first chance at a small piece of the wild not since he was 2 years old had he experienced the sight and especially the complexity of sounds of a natural ocean environment it had been 23 years half his expected lifetime since Keiko had even seen the bottom of the sea [Applause] caicos world was gradually expanded for the next step a satellite tag was attached to his rare flop dorsal fin in order to follow it at sea it's attachment was no more painful than piercing linear but the tag and cake would have to waited another season following complications to be tested at sea finally the summer of 2000 sea trials began everything from then on was uh pancake up the difficult promise to give them the choice of freedom had been kept then at last Keiko was within feet of wild killer whales he seemed enthusiastic at first but then experienced what might have been shyness were fear and turned back my regulars later encounters with aggressive and Keiko continued to seek the shelter of the boat keV over three summers Keiko continued to approach passing whales spending more time with him possibly learning their ways then in 2002 after watching a pod feed on herring he simply swam away in the proximity of whales for over two months Keiko was tracked by satellite his course revealed no details about his experiences in the wild but he emerged a thousand miles away sufficiently fed and unscathed an enormous success [Music] then perhaps seeking human companionship or just chasing an easy meal Keiko followed a fishing boat into a Norwegian Fjord Keiko was still alone but he was welcomed by enchanted children who must have felt they already knew him strong bonds are undeniably formed between captive orcas like Keiko and people but we've been slow to consider that the oceans greatest predator wild and free may also be curious to understand us Oh you watch do both of these whales take interest in your boat well you know as a scientist you have to say no but as a whale hugger oh for sure you know there's no doubt in my mind the water like that we can see just like you can mrs. gold so you know leaning over and looking at and I find if I if I take no notice of them and I be you know put on my scientific case I just take my notes everything they don't interact so if I can have a good time with them and and really interact with us then they get all opposed as well in an effort to both protect orders and to involve the public over hotline Ingrid speaking Ingrid founded the orca project Kotla oh that's fantastic news in so what direction were they going when you saw them her nationally advertised number rings with reports of Orca sightings and strandings like that of the whale she named that I've been he's stranded in 1997 and I knew him before the stranding but when you're involved with an animal at that sort of level there's just something about it you know and they look you in the eye and they're at your mercy to rescue them and with them we had an overnight ordeal and then we rescued him and the next day he was back with another group of Orca which was just incredible but a year later and he got run over by a boat and it was just tragic but a year later I found him and his dorsal fin the back half had completely collapsed and folded over so now he's got this funny little fin where butt sticks up in the the wrist folds down but he survived and he's very cautious of boats now but he'll still come over to my boat I think that by showing people the variation within the individuals it makes the animals a little bit more personable if you like if somebody can call me up and say hey I just saw Ben it gives them a little bit of a stake in Ben's life and so hopefully you know they'll slow down their boats they'll Drive a little more respectfully the data of course is really valuable for my research but ultimately I wanted to be that the public will want to protect these animals CACO however was at risk of being loved too much by well-meaning public the Norwegian government passed laws to protect him and the Free Willy Keiko foundation in the humane society of the u.s. agreed to continue his care he arrived in Norway obviously having fed himself at sea but without fish in the fjord concern grew and the decision was made to begin feeding him again Kengo had everything he needed except the company of his own kind in 2003 after more than a year in Norway at age 26 relatively young for a male Orca Keiko took a final breath and died from a pneumonia like virus his burial was the last outpouring of affection for the whale we thought we knew and who had done everything we asked [Music] CACO was the whale we had forever changed and no matter how good our attentions he was the way we couldn't fix for him to become what nature had intended and orchid the clothes company of other whales [Music] it was impossible even for the world's most loved most famous whale I think it would be quite impossible for anybody to propose capturing an ogre at least in North American waters at this point so I think in that sense we've come quite a long way in terms of public attitudes in terms of what we understand about all this but we've also come a long way I think at this point we understand enough about a Vulcan society to realize that this is complex and remarkable and fascinating and with we don't have the whole story yet but what we do understand is really really interesting the debate about returning captive orcas to the wild and keeping them in captivity continues passionately especially as we learn more about them and continue to discover that there may be few other species more like ourselves there do still remain countries tolerant of capturing orcas but in most of the world any up-close hands-on contact comes when a whale ends up on the beach stranded Ingrid Visser is again changing what we know there was a lot of controversy and they still is about saving stranded whales and dolphins people say that they have a crushed internal organs from sitting on the beach for so long and then other people say that they're no longer viable the stress hormones and all of the sort of thing that these animals can't reproduce and that they're basically a drain on society and people come back because they're going to be eating fish and contributing nothing so miracle she's stranded she was rescued then I saw her again after the risk of three years later and then about five years later as she had the best car and that car is called magic so it was really really incredible to see miracle who had this training event being rescued and then having a very best car from the carpus survived so yeah magic it was I call the hotline and we're speaking in the middle of her research Henry gets a call that a small female orca is stranded on an isolated beach and heavy surf she and the team rushed to assist she's somewhere on this bit of coastline here we're not sure exactly where but this area here these lines on the chart are marking that it's really rough and surf breaking so we're kind of hoping we'll be able to pick her up and move it by tractor and trailer somewhere into here okay well let's do it [Music] time is critical upon a stranding rescue so Ingrid and jean-michele will fly directly while the team drives the five hours to the site New Zealand's Hills are bordered by a twisting 90 300 mile coastline whale strandings are fairly common but successful rescues are not [Music] the Orca was first sighted around one o'clock by some hikers in a very remote part of the west coast west of Oakland tossing and turning in the surf we ultimately got to the beach and indeed this young female a little over three meters long was very badly stranded so when we actually first saw her of course there's just the natural emotions of just wanting to break down and cry and knowing that she's away from her family and knowing that she has no idea for people that are going to help her or hurt her but help comes by digging holes for her flukes and flippers to relieve the discomfort then keeping her skin moist [Music] she was probably not alone struggling in the surf and another whale may have tried to pull her back to sea judging from the marks raked across her tail stock Ingrid names her Reiki [Music] most important to her survival is keeping the young whale hydrated after hours of stress on the beach Ingrid is successful in getting her to accept a to bringing water [Music] it's a triage that also involves reassurance and comfort and yeah even with expert care under changing conditions it's believed an orca can survive only about 24 hours out of water hopefully shall be okay then hopefully reunited with our part she's a young female needs a family we're very very anxious to see her back in the ocean in our world we move the animal just just right up above this tiny little town where there is a facility where we could pull the truck and the trailer right next to a fresh water source so we had a hose where we could water her down and we had an ongoing watch throughout the night but finally by 4:00 a.m. we knew it was time for Ingrid and Karl and the team to discuss what the options were to get her back into the water there was a family with Kyle and I have done orcas trainings before with two hours after we released the Orca um it made up with its family so they can be a long way away and the animals will return if they hear her they won't be able to hear her call her if she's inside here over the bow of the surf but don't if we take her to the other coast 100% guarantee she won't find your family immediately through that's the worst calm and through both scenarios is that where is her family I defeated more than that biological and gives you a knowledge of the animals which is a running operation staying here here's as you can appreciate by far its much don't see it yeah it is definitely that for her and it's better to have her on the others other coast weird and she knows very well that pods here off the North Island will visit the West and East Coast frequently so she felt confident putting this animal in the east side of the country that there is a very good chance that this young whale will hook up with her family in the near future a decision is made to move Reiki to the East Coast and the team prepares for what must be done to save the whale for the heart monitor we put it on early in the morning and Ingrid wanted to keep track of her heartbeat throughout the rest of her time on the flat bed it's becoming clear to the team that a positive outcome for the rescue is not guaranteed [Music] for me personally it was the first time I've seen a Orca so close but Ingrid with her trust in us we really were not only filming and assisting but we were participant and when she had asked me to sit next to the whale and help keep the heart monitor on her the entire time it was my job than to really have that continuous touch with the animal and really hopefully transmit my calmness to this animal and her heart was very normal was average between 60 and 80 heart beats per minute and there were times when it even dipped a little bit which was hopefully a sign of her calmness and so on unusual procession moves through New Zealand's largest city so we drove right through the heart of Auckland 90 minutes through town with a moment of just sitting there thinking I'm with the whale I'm sitting here with the whale we finally arrived over the east side and pull into the harbor and the ramp we're about to put the animal in the water and there's well over 100 plus people cheering as we drive up [Music] the whale is gently rocked into the water but is disoriented from the ordeal and lies still from there there's a whole flood of emotions and at first the animal is hardly moving at all and Ingrid like it's alright you know her muscles we could just imagine your muscles is cramped for hours and hours not being able to stretch so she just is probably just you know stretching out and getting back into this fluid environment and finally Ingrid says just have some of the people back away and only two of you stay close to her to support her [Music] so sure enough as soon as three people backed away from the animal Karl and one of the staff are right by the head she just gives a big kick of her tail and you just see the movement and her dorsal fin just sliced through the water she slowly traveled out in the deeper water we've heard the stories of dolphins pushing people in need back to shore and now this team has carried a young whale back to the sea was a chance at life perhaps occurs and people share an additional trait the ability to care for another species including each other you know complicated relationship with nature it may be a bond unlike any other I think I've only just began to scratch the surface with these guys pretty much every time I go out I see something new interesting and I just wish I knew so much more about them just the real basic site where they go when I don't know where they are what are they saying to each other how do they teach the young ones how to catch things what happens to the win they're naughty and just yeah fun stuff like that as well and then on the science side of things how are they impacted by pollution in the marine environment what sort of things can we do to protect their habitat if you teach people about these animals they're going to understand them better and if they understand them better they're gonna love them more and if they love them more then yeah they're gonna look after them I hope for a long time it stumped me people go why do we need the whales why do we need the whales you know in truth why do I need my earlobe you know why do I need any specific part of my body because it's part of the whole and you can live without carts but it's a degraded existence because it's all knitted together to learn how some of the characteristics we consider strictly human-like language and culture may have also evolved among killer whales [Music] they'll travel among groups of orcas that are as similar and as different as we are from each other [Music] their journey begins in the Pacific Northwest where orcas have been revered by native people for millennia studied by scientists for decades and where our story of the complicated relationship between orcas and people begins what we're trying to do is to make a connection between humans and nature comparing humans and orcas they are the dominant species in the ocean we are the dominant species on land and we all depend on the same thing the killer whale the orcas is such a powerful animal in terms of its appeal to people it captivates the imagination because we know that there are large dolphins and they are very intelligent they live in very social groups much like our own John Ford is a pioneer in Orca acoustics the first scientist identified dialects in their calls and to change our beliefs even though I've only been involved studying orcas for around, 30, years things have changed so drastically in our attitude towards this incredible animal the attitude at that time was that these were dangerous animals a threat to people a threat to the livelihood of fishermen and I was caught up in that when I was young growing up on Vancouver Island here we'd go out fishing and a group of orcas would go by and we would be terrified if they swam under the boat because that was the feeling that these were dangerous animals on our coast in the 1960s to mid-1970s there was a live capture fishery for orcas and they were sent to aquariums all over the world I actually got a job at the Vancouver Aquarium and soon became a whale trainer in the early 70s and got to know them in that context and they were fascinating animals of course and even then it was quite controversial holding them in captivity but I I realized we had so much to learn from them orcas have very large complex brains and when I first caught sight of Anoka brain which was in a jar on a shelf in a lab I was really quite amazed so the first question that came to me was what does this whale do with that brain still the question asker that was 40 years ago and you worked with some animals in captivity in 1967 behavioral research with an orca M spanner at the Vancouver Aquarium and they wanted somebody to study the whale what did you learn from her uh mostly I think I learned that this was a very unsuitable place to keep a remarkable being that was around the time actually that dr. Michael big who died in 1990 and was very much our mentor and the true pioneer whose vision led to photo identification he started learning highly intelligent dangerously powerful the unchallenged sovereign of Earth's oceans they are the orc killer whales and they're complex societies extend back into antiquity but does our modern society now threaten there's join jean-michel Cousteau and his team as they investigate humankind's mirror in the water and discover that the orcas fight for survival is in fact now our own its jean-michel Cousteau ocean tech ventures [Music] Eve she was a wonderful whale when I was first out here I had no VHF radio had no radar I just mean have a compass and once became and lost in the fog I felt like I was in a glass of milk you just can't see anything and I could hear on the hydrophone this big cruise ship headed for me anyway Eve and her family the next 20 minutes came up so close to my boat that I was constantly switching the engine into neutral because I didn't want to hit them and after a few minutes I could just barely see something in oh was an island and I popped out and I was into the glorious sunset and in the clear and I kept waiting for Eve's family to come out of the fog but they never did and that was for me it was like worlds colliding trying to figure out what had gone on that she had turned around that she stayed by my boat and then when the I was safe she turned around again and at that moment I believed all the stories about dolphins pushing sailors to shore I don't know what it is about these whales but they they do things like that in everyone studying these whales sees the same thing they are our counterparts in the seat with the most complex marine species on the planet or come ruler of the ocean male orcas can be nine tons, 30, -two feet long with a towering dorsal fin six feet tall but crowned with a smaller curved fit it made me the females that rule the pod they are the most widely distributed marine mammal in the world their realm extends from the Arctic to the Antarctic largest of the dolphins orcas also called killer whales number fewer than a hundred thousand worldwide and finding them take John Michell Cousteau and his team across the globe accompanied at times by his son Fabian and daughters to lean the cusco team will turn into both the northern and southern hemispheres as they seek out killer whales in the Pacific Ocean the team will discover that people in orcas share surprising similarities even similar needs a fact made clear by their experiences with Keiko the world's most famous killer whale the team will offand for weeks and didn't survive her death for very long generally the males will join their sister's family but they become a loose satellite they never again have the bond that they had with the mother it's a unique social system ork is a very conservative animal basically you only socialize with somebody who your mother introduced you to the resident populations on this coast are really very clearly divided socially into two different groups in northern residents about 240 whales 16 pods the southern residents are around 90 whales 3 pods quite a bit smaller what's really interesting we don't really understand this but they never mix and then we have overlaying that we have transients the mammal hunters they don't mix with the residents but they will often mix with other transients and then occasionally we have these offshore whales and they don't mix with these others either so we have these whales that in many ways are just focused on they're very familiar neighboring groups that are up the same lifestyle it's a pattern strangely familiar much like human tribes existing near each other but separate with languages and behaviors learned and passed on over generations we defined it as culture and for both humans and orcas different cultures exist among the same species [Music] and they both the New Zealand author I found are just so completely different from the Pacific Northwest I had this paradigm that that was how Orca we're out in the world that they had a maitre lineal Society and stayed and very strongly bonded groups and that there was another population who fed on marine mammals well it turns out here that the New Zealand Orca are moving around between groups they feed on fish sharks rays and marine mammals acoustically they're different they have a good Kiwi twang just like I do and it looks like they're moving big distances compared to the animals up there I got them traveling an average of 100 to 150 kilometers a day and I think there's one of the things that fascinates me about all fairness the different cultures even though they're in similar habitats they're just so completely different workers have been stable in their social groups that we're looking at now for literally thousands of years if you look at the society and understand that this has evolved over a very long period of time he realized that you're looking at a successful society the wild part the challenge for him would be enormous since strong social bonds may actually define what it means to be an orca at the time no one knew how to free a captive Orca it was a new frontier two trainers like Steve Clausen for 10 years and DeSean Michelle who became involved in the effort and who saw Keiko is a symbol of more than just one whale curator Nolan Hardy knew how far Keiko was from a wild Orca we're trying to teach Keiko to not only work for us within the school sing about the societies that these whales live in around our coast and that these were incredibly complex animals with very elaborate social relationships you put the brain and the implications of that together with the social side and you understand immediately that putting her in a concrete tank and completely shutting off the company of her kind was a Norma Sri unfair and inappropriate thing to be doing but at the time it was through the close contact of captivity that we begin to learn about them one at a time the story of one whale in particular named Keiko stirred our passion and raised enduring questions about captivity Keiko was captured in 1979 in Iceland and became one of the 136 orcas taken into captivity since 1961 but he did not become one of the more than 100 that have died there one of the 42 killer whales that remain in captivity captured at age two and eventually sent to Mexico City Keiko was breathing the world's smallest air a master of the ocean at 7,000 feet above sea level in the artificial seawater of a shallow pool where he entertained the crowds kenka would have lived his life in poor health swimming in circles except for one thing he became a movie star as Willie he was free to 10,000,000 filmgoing children but in reality Keiko went nowhere the stress of his environment caused the skin disease which spread as his health seriously deteriorated the real whale was slowly dying and Keiko had to be moved when it was learned that Keiko was still captive millions of children wrote it demanding his freedom and a spontaneous movement was started to free the sick whale caicos owners donated him for the unprecedented experiment of reintroducing him into the wild and the Oregon Coast Aquarium customized the pool for his care suddenly the reality of free and Keiko became far more interesting than the movie as Keiko began a long and complicated journey toward freedom ultimately true freedom for Keiko would mean being accepted into a part of wild Wales since orcas live their entire lives and tightly connected social groups where all members are related to each other it's now understood the best chance for Keiko would be to find his mother it very much is a matriarchal society or matrilineal in that everybody in the group is related through female descent to a female ancestor individuals stay with their mother or their grandmother for the whole life and it took some years to really understand that because it is very unusual in that the large adult males never leave the group the bond between a mature male and his mother is very very strong I know that Eve the whale that came to you in the fog was a matriarch what happened when she passed away even Lee had two sons not--not daughters and those two males went around Hansen Isle we can take better care of him but we need to let him become a killer well again we need God trained him our goal all along has been to give him control of his life we're an active part of it especially since he is here by himself but the idea is to let him start making those decisions on what he wants to do when he wants to do it but previously any time he did it somebody asked for it even with vastly improved conditions Keiko continued to demonstrate his frustration from living in an artificial environment he expressed his stress in Mexico by knowing the concrete pool damaging his teeth and it continued an Oregon on his favorite rock a decision was made to cover it in order to discourage the behavior and to protect the teeth of the ocean's greatest predator in orcish sharp conical shaped teeth make feeding on large prey possible but Keiko primarily eats fish which orcas swallow whole so his damaged teeth should not be a problem in the wild when he arrived in Oregon Keiko was a thousand pounds underweight but soon doubled what he was eating in Mexico his waistline increased by three feet he gained nearly 2,000 pounds and grew eight inches longer [Music] but he still had to be taught to catch live fish as a milestone for his release and in order to survive in the wild accustomed to only dead fish at first he treated the live nail like a toy surrounded by walls Keiko had never been observed using echolocation in captivity and to a wild killer whale it's a fundamental skill the whales hearing spectrum is many times ours their sensitivity is incredible they see with sound so when they're finding food they use their echolocation they make sounds they get echoes and they can turn that into a mental 3-dimensional image sometimes you know when you go into different places around the world and you look at look at what orcas are doing and understand that they sort of figured out how to live in the particular niche that they happen to have found it's really interesting looking at the differences as gray whales migrate up the coast through Monterey California a part of transient orcas show either wolves of the sea they hunt in packs to isolate then overpower a gray whale calf it's a predictable hunt but as many as a third of the calves taken by orcas 20 to 30 whales may work together and share the bounty shirring seems to be really important in these groups that seems to be part of the way that the whales live together to avoid competition certainly they foots you when it comes to feeding on larger animals but that's probably more a facet of the fact that these things that they're feeding on like whales are so big and there's not many of them and to
the coast of southern Australia is one of the most inhospitable in the world lashed by storms that roll unchecked all away from the Antarctic ice captain across the barren southern ocean to beat themselves against the rampart cliffs of the continent [Music] cut off by sea from the rest of the planet the land creatures of Australia have evolved in a totally different way to those elsewhere and off the shores of this island continent the undersea world is equally fascinating around it's cooler and rugged southern coastline there are many hidden secrets and species of sea creatures that are found nowhere else because just as on the land life under the ocean surface has evolved in its own unique and little-known way [Music] [Music] washed up on a beach these egg cases are a clue to the whereabouts of one of Australia's weirdest sharks every year in July which is the depth of winter in the southern hemisphere Port Jackson sharks travel many hundreds of kilometres to gather in huge numbers the shallow coastal waters of southern Australia it's the long-distance traveller of Australian sharks and it has just one purpose in mind to find a mint one of the most unusual sharks port Jackson's skin is made up of tiny denticles that give it a rough texture spines in front of its fins give added protection from larger sharks the range in these Southern Oceans actively hunting for food they scour the seafloor rummaging for urgence starfish mollusks and crustaceans most people's preconceptions of sharks is that they all have viciously sharp teeth but that's far from the truth the port Jackson's powerful jaw is adapted not to tearing and ripping the flesh of other creatures but rather into crushing and grinding its prey gulping mouthfuls of sand they filter it through their gills to sieve out from it anything edible sometimes feeding can become a frenzy as more and more port Jackson's pile into an area where food has been found most species of sharks have to keep swimming in order to maintain the flow of water over their gills to breathe however port Jackson's don't need to do this as they are able to lie on the seabed and pump sufficient water through their gills to enable them to breathe without continuously being on the move but the main reason they're here is to mate what appears from a distance to be a dead shark on the sea floor is in fact two sharks in the throes of what for port jackson's it's the height of passion locked together in mating and it's another reason why their skin needs to be so tough this shark still bears the marks of a previous mating encounter by late in the southern winter the female will deposit individual egg cases deep in the rocks often returning to the same nesting sites here after here it's a uniquely shaped hard spiral egg case and it would be between nine to, 12, months before a perfectly formed baby Port Jackson emerges right but in these storm lashed waters many become dislodged and end up washed up on the shoreline and it may be that the egg cases face danger too from an unexpected source from their own species this port Jackson sucking the contents from an egg case is behavior that has never before been observed or filmed an unexplained mystery of these southern shores you'll know these sharks are relatively common along this coast we still have a lot to learn about their secret lives [Music] mention the underwater world of Australia to anyone and they'll immediately think of the Great Barrier Reef the giant coral structure running for 2,000 kilometers of the northeast coast of continent but this vast land has many other environments and it's the colder waters in its southern shores that hold the most secrets it's a coastline that several thousand kilometers long with a landscape that epitomizes the image of the dry Sun bait wide-open spaces of the outback Australia is a huge isolated island continent almost the size of the whole of mainland Europe so it's hardly surprising but land animals here have evolved very differently to the rest of the world however what's far more surprising is that in the cooler and little-known oceanic waters off the south of the continent the sea life was also developed in isolation with a large proportion of the species found here being unique to these seas and found nowhere else on the planet [Music] octopus some members of a larger grouping of sea creatures known to science as cephalopods a combination of two Greek words that together mean head footed because all their limbs have come directly off their head cuttlefish and squid are also members of this family which contains some of the most complex diverse and fascinating creatures on earth they're among the oldest species in our planet's oceans even before dinosaurs roamed the land and millions of years before fish evolved fossil records show that the oceans teemed with swarming cephalopods the seas of southern Australia are home to a wide variety of these ancient beings including some of the strangest members of the settle pod family their eyesight is among the most highly developed of any sea creature as they rely on their heightened sense of vision to hunt completely to spot predators their eyes have also evolved to enable them to see in the dark night sea when many of them emerge to hunt within their skins of thousands of tiny ink filled sacks called chromatophores which enable them to rapidly change that color and appearance these color changes can signify alarm differing moods can be used for camouflage mimicry and for communication with others of the same species [Music] all our carnivorous feeding on other fish and on mollusks and all are fallacious predators shooting out their feeding tentacles with lightning-fast speed to grab their prey which is then drawn back to the sharp hard beaks to be chewed before swallowing others simply envelop their prey though on this occasion the hermit crab survives with a little help from its mate easy prey to many fishes they have evolved different modes of survival many are nocturnal hunters hiding in crevices and under rocks during the day others like these tiny bobtail squid simply dig into the seafloor for safety using their fins and Jets of water to dig themselves in this appropriately named pyjama squid is found nowhere else but this southern Australian ocean little round bodied squid they spend the day buried emerging only at night in to feed some lay eggs in large clutches are they attached to a fixed object on the seabed others carry their eggs on their bodies until they hatch the blue ringed octopus is an exception among cephalopods as it is deadly poisonous to predators its iridescent blue rings warning potential attackers of its lethal venom few other octopus are poisonous and they have to rely on color change and camouflage for their protection or if danger threatens they can simply sink into the sand like subsea Meadows vast swathe of seagrass come in large areas of the seabed of southern Australia sea creatures have evolved to live in these highly specialized environments and are totally different to those found on the open ocean floor to blend in with the seagrass firstly shape is important so that the fish appears to be just another strand of vegetation secondly pattern is essential it's only when this clean fish moves that it becomes apparent that the fish is not just another strand of grass the closer you investigate the seagrass the more secrets are found hidden there probably even now many pairs have perfectly hidden eyes appearing cautiously back at the camera totally unseen among their environment appearing like a brown stalk of grass makes this pipefish almost invisible its environment the final element of survival in the sea grass is color some fish have become so specialized and so localized to just one type of vegetation that their color is an absolutely perfect match to their surroundings this pygmy leather jacket looks like just another leaf of seaweed so exact is the color match because camouflage is essential to escape from the Predators that roam in from the open sea been to hunt in the vast sea grass Plains very different creatures have evolved to live in these specialized environments cramps don't have the ability to change color and the hard sharp outline of their shell would make them stand out among the soft contours of the seafloor vegetation making them easy pickings for predators so they pluck grass and weed from their surroundings and adorn themselves with it so that they can blend in the crab shell is covered with tiny hook like hairs almost like velcro which holds this camouflage in place this baby Port Jackson shark has only just hatched from its egg case like juvenile fish of many species it seeks the protection offered by the sea grass which is essential if it is to survive to grow to maturity the rich profusion of life in the southern ocean supports large colonies of seals and the rocky coastline sparsely inhabited by humans is the ideal terrain than to live and breathe in the early 19th century hunters for seal pelts drove this species to the edge of extinction today seals are protected in these waters and their numbers are increasing some estimates place the population as high as 25,000 that successful recovery has brought its own problems some blame them for falling commercial fish caches and many fishermen would like to see their protection renewed on land seals are ungainly clumsy with slow-moving underwater they're transformed into sleek and graceful dances they need every ounce of speed and agility they can muster underwater to evade their main enemy the great white shark shark watching has become big business off the coast of southern Australia divers traveling from all around the world for the chance of a face-to-face encounter with the oceans apex predator the great white the shark are drawn in by chumming the water with fish blood and guts you don't get much closer to a great white shark than this most of the pictures and films that you see of these ultimate hunters would have been taken from shark cages like this one the great white may be the main attraction for shark watchers but another equally fascinating species of shark is found in these waters which bites more people a year than great whites [Music] first named by the Aborigines the wobbegongs camouflage helps it to blend in with its reef home even the tasseled flaps of skin around its mouth breaking up its outline because they're so well hidden wobbegongs actually bite more people than any other shark in Australian waters though usually their bite is defensive rather than aggressive often because a diver accidentally disturbs or touches one without even seeing it it's not the most vicious of bites and it's rarely life-threatening as wobbegongs tend to lock onto their prey rather than slash and cut wobbegongs like most shark species a slow growing slow to mature and have relatively few young with a recently established fishery targeting them to meet the demand from the fish and chip trade there's been a marked decline in the numbers of this once common and typically Australia but the strangest of all sharks is the saw shark and this creature is found nowhere else over the southern Australian coast very little is known about this bizarre and secretive shop it's generally found only in deep water and usually only encountered when trolled up in fishing nets [Music] a bottom-feeding shark it feeds by digging small fish and crabs from the seabed sensing the prey with the sensitive barbels hanging from its snout and using the saw like extension to dig them out and then strike and slash at them before eating [Music] another sharp as adopted perhaps the most unusual of hunting techniques it lies in hiding and then ambushes its prey is this just a ridge on the sea floor a small school of scat Olivia Stu danger or watch her in the sand [Music] under deadly strike from one of the ocean's best hidden predators here it is again frame by frame the figures are hundredths of a second the actual strike takes just two camera friends just eight hundredths of a second within point two of a second the shark has caught the fish and is already dragging it down and in less than two seconds the fish has totally disappeared the angel sharks technique is completely different to the foraging of the Port Jackson though they share the same living space it's a perfect ambush predator motionless and concealed until it strikes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the sheer size and scale of Australia is astonishing seemingly endless stretching as far as the eye can see while roads now link the vast open spaces of the southern Australian outback this hasn't always been so before the arrival of the roads wheat and wool the staple cash crops of the region could only be shipped by sea to the cities and so in the late 19th century jetties sprang up along this stretch of inhospitable coastline disused now many have fallen into disrepair others have been preserved a small number are still in use all have become landmark features of this coastline and for the creatures of the sea they have provided a new living space a place of safety from the open ocean [Music] [Music] [Music] the pilings themselves have provided a surface for an enemy's sponges and decisions every inch being coated with they're bright colored coverings and they and their own turn offer a sanctuary to fish that have evolved to match perfectly their cards old industrial structures of steel and would have become festooned with color and other creatures that live under the jetties have their own coats for protection [Music] decorator crabs have evolved an individual and unique style of camouflage plucking parts of an enemy's and sponges they attach them to their bodies softening the contours and helping them to blend in with their surroundings if in areas of weed then that is plucked as their chosen camouflage attire [Music] frogfish go one better than decorator crabs they actually grow filaments on their bodies and remaining motionless merge into the background it's only when they move that the frogfish becomes visible and is at risk from predators [Music] even the best of camouflage may not prove to be enough a group of fish pick over the carcass of an unlucky crab the slugs of the sea are called nudibranch and they come in a rainbow DeRay of colors and shapes [Music] nudibranch slay thousands of eggs attaching them to a rock or some other solid object on the seafloor these pygmy leather jackets are feasting on a freshly laid egg cluster no matter how sharp and numerous your spines no matter how seemingly impenetrable your defenses may be there is always someone who can break through them few would take on a spiny sea urchin but the spines are no problem for a tough mouth of the Berlin grouper other strange creatures of the southern ocean shallows also make their homes below the man-made structures [Music] much of the ocean floor is just flat sand offering little shelter and few creatures live there it's where the sea meets the land where rocky reefs and islets occur that there are the greatest concentrations of life these outcrops and reefs offer shelter and protection a surface on which weed and sponges can grow inevitably such profusion of life attract predators and the whole food chain lives in a fragile balance man-made structures in the sea weather accidentals such as shipwrecks or deliberate such as jetties provide welcome additional living space and rapidly become colonized an artificial environment which quickly becomes a complete undersea community [Music] this undersea battle lasted for two days and each time we returned to this particular spot under a jetty to film the fight was still continuing to humanize there seemed no good reason for the crabs to slug it out for so long why didn't one simply retreat or move on to a more peaceful spot on the sea bear but de soft-bodied crabs like the hermit crab the empty shell of a sea snail is the secret to survival as they outgrow their temporary homes finding a larger one becomes essential maybe this was a contest to determine which crab was moving to a larger shell and so gain its protection have you ever walked along the city street at night looking over your shoulder feeling that someone's watching following you maybe going to muggy well there are also villains in the nocturnal sea carrier crabs are creatures of the night they cut lumps of living sponge to use as both shield as camouflage so valuable is his protection but they will even resort to mugging other crabs for choice beasts when this crab spots another with a coat of sponge that he fancies himself he starts to pull it from the back of a small arrival when he separates the sponge from his previous owner who takes it for himself to wear adjusting the fit of the sponge with his back legs the Victor leaves the scene of the crime with his spoils perfect fit [Music] seahorses are big business whether for souvenirs or to meet the insatiable demand from the traditional Chinese medicine trade the market is ever-increasing if taken from the wild the species will become extinct in no time at all so in Australia in a proactive mood to protect the population in the wild sea horse farms are now in business to supply the sea horse trade this factory specializes in breeding for the aquarium trade and seahorses from here may be exported to collectors around the world pregnancy horses give birth to huge numbers of perfectly-formed live young which are then separated from the parent and raised here until large enough to either join the breeding stock or to be sold [Music] but in the wild not only is this Southern Ocean haven for seahorses but also for their close relatives the weedy and leafy sea dragons the most treasured secret of these seas [Music] the leafy sea dragon is perhaps the most spectacularly camouflaged fish in the ocean [Music] it's leafy appendages are there for just one purpose to make them invisible against their environment [Music] [Music] and both leafy and weedy sea dragons are only found in one area of the ocean in the cool waters of the southern Australian coast this is one of the most ancient creatures in the world's oceans it's also one of the Seas most voracious predators they hunt by day and little is safe from their lethal strike and of all the cuttlefish found in the world sees growing to over a metre in length that giant Australian cuttlefish is the biggest once a year they congregate in their thousands in a very small area of the southern Australian coast moving in from a deep water to shallow reefs only a couple of metres deep where they engage in a frenzy of mating it's an ancient and stylized Richard the pulsating patterns of the larger male have two purposes they serve both to attract females and to warn off potential rivals in this mating Luthor turu the female the male shows his finest display if she's receptive than they couple face to face locked together the male passes sperm filled packets to a pouch under the females mouth she then starts to lay her eggs he's sealing them individually and carefully crevices and under rocks on the seabed passing them each in turn over the male's sperm package in order to fertilize them but it's at this stage that there's trouble rival males attempt to replace the sperm with their own so the male must stand guard over the female lays her eggs it's an example of the principle of natural selection and survival of species the strongest will fertilize the eggs passing on his genes to the next generation in the frenzy there can be many rivals attempting to get to the female as she lays competitions fierce and in the free-for-all competing males can mob a single available female flaring his arms out to their full length to make himself appear as largest and with colors pulsating their electronic signals the male squares up to his rival both rolling onto their sides to maximize the impact of their display the speed and intensity of the signals varying with the message and emotion that the cuttlefish is transmitting often the posturing alone is enough to chase off a weaker or smaller rival but if two evenly matched males square up a fight can develop and many bear breeding scars from the bites and suckers of their rivals while the males attentions are distracted by one rival others seize the opportunity to sneak into the momentarily unguarded once the eggs are laid the interest of both male and female animals and the eggs are left alone to hatch mating is the culmination of the life of the cuttlefish and after the mating aggregation the cuttlefish returned to the open ocean the lifespan of the giant cuttlefish is just a couple of years and they see just one mating aggregation in their short lives wherever fisherman I grew up to clean their catch there is always the chance of a free meal stingrays have learnt this lesson over time and they thrive around the fishing harbors scattered along the coast in this southern Australian Bay smooth Ray's spend their days cruising the harbour shallows in search of scraps it's very unusual to see eagle rays in shallow water they're usually fish of the open ocean but they have also learnt of the chance of free food and are from time to time also spotted here and the shallow waters of harvest grays and shark are all part of the same family of fishes known to scientists at last my ranks and the seafloor of southern Australia is home to many unusual rays there are about 50 different species of Gray's in Australian waters much of their lives are spent hidden under the sand only their eyes protruding their mouths are on the underside of their flattened bodies and they feed on crabs and fish buried in the sand but there are other rays that have a far more sinister hunting technique the number a has a very unique method of taking its brain 220 volts a severe electrical shock the same as the jolt you get from your home electrical system if you know what that feels like to a fully grown human being and try and imagine the effect on a fish the shock is more than enough to stand on properly killer fish giving the ray all the time it needs to eat it and the number is capable of repeating that charge as many as 50 times from just 10 minutes the speed of the strike is faster than the eye can see as the race spits out a fish stunned shuddering from the voltage coursing through its body but why let the fish escape let's rewind the tape and watch it again it's only when the shot is replayed in slow motion of the answer becomes apparent in a lightning-fast movement the REA envelops not one but two fish and even this creature of nightmares can only consume one fish at a time there are many surprising often beautiful and sometimes shocking secrets hidden beneath the Seas of southern Australian
water the liquid that oceans are made of and it fills endless depths only few will venture out into the endless open ocean of this vast underwater world most of the ocean inhabitants live in the city as it were like human societies very close together with friendly neighbors and nasty co-tenants while dangerous robbers lurk around at the edge of town to assert yourself here you have to be equipped with all kinds of tricks and clever strategies or lie and cheat coral reefs are the largest structures in the world they're giant submerged metropolis [Music] millions of different inhabitants live in these cities a universe with coral palaces and soaring towers [Music] every neighborhood has a chief the entire street belongs to this guy no trespassing okay a typical large city with all the noise and ruckus [Music] even this little porcupine fish bleats around it creates the sound with its swim bladder two small Harlequin shrimps are nibbling on this blue sea star if someone else shows up he will catch hell another harlequin shrimp busy pulling a bite out of a sea star moray eels in disagreement a scorpion fish shuffles across the ocean floor everything and everybody makes a lot of noise a boxer crab threatens everybody that comes by holding two poisonous andamanese in its claws at least the anemone reef looks peaceful or does it the clown fishes are having a huge squabble who does this anemone belong to we can hardly see this fish but he's easy to hear a crocodile fish does this giant puffer fish hear something it's array that's getting away a dispute amongst the members of the cichlid family who is stronger and especially who is louder to Walkman fish are noisily trying to woo a female big city noise everywhere especially when a large structure is being torn down everybody lives in their own way in this noisy metropolis some hover above it all but others are more down-to-earth and literally live in the coral sand these goat fishes for example they plow through the ocean floor and catch smaller animals between their teeth they use their barbells like a dowser with them they can detect even the weakest electric fields that point them towards small prey [Music] these go-biz also dredge through the sand and feed on what they find in there there's another way of finding prey in the sand this blue spotted stingray uses its wings like shovels and there's always a chance of stealing something while one works others just stand by and feed on what's left over maybe a piece of crab or a mussel you have to be very familiar with this area to find the best morsels [Music] this triggerfish uses a strong stream of water the fish blows away the sand to on earth whatever is hidden inside it others are quick to steal whatever they can the triggerfish is a commanding fish and most reef inhabitants are easily intimidated by him except for these strange visitors that don't seem to show fear in any case it's best to cover them up with sand [Music] [Music] it's not easy for a small fish in a big city there's always somebody with bad intentions and you have to be extra careful not to get swallowed like these moon races for example so it's always safer for the smallest among the reef inhabitants to show up in schools it's difficult to keep an eye out for only one little fish and as a result the predator often grabs blindly at nothing and comes up empty to show up in a big mob is always safest others are easily distracted at the sight of so much prey all at once this easygoing giant puffer fish would never have a chance here anyway being part of a school of fish is always the best protection from predators the slow ones are being ignored no danger here [Music] the school distributes the danger if there are a thousand fishes any of them can be the target and 999 are going to be just fine but what about loners or those that live as a couple see horses for example camouflage themselves to look like the coral branches they're holding on to even more difficult to see where is the animal here only the eye betrays this trumpetfish is camouflage they do everything to not look like themselves ornate ghost pipefish --is they're inseparable a couple the female is already carrying eggs in her extended belly [Music] before long the male will fertilize her eggs they're still regular fishes despite their unique costume this one looks like torn off seagrass the spiny wasp fish rocks back and forth in the current not a monster but ingenious camouflage a spider crab that's decorated its head with a sponge this will deter any predator another great camouflage a barrel decorated with rocks only the movement of the gills betrays this stonefish even a smack with a fin doesn't bother him the fish knows it will not hurt him it only shoves him a little further to the side similarly tough are its cousins the scorpion fishes they lie there as if dead especially when others around them freak out and even when moray eels fight with lion fishes the scorpion fish lies in wait for his chance and then immediately becomes completely motionless again the only difference is that it raises its dorsal fins with the poisonous Barb's inside is completely still but now also armed this large angler fish virtually blends into the background tangle of algae and leaves right now the angler fish is on high alert it ejects a large cloud in order to throw off predators it's not the time to feed or catch anything it's angling rod is lying flat on the fish's back the white tip at the end of the rod is used to lure prey [Music] the anglerfish feels threatened by something finally it gives up its camouflage and moves further over using its fins to float as soon as the fish retracts the fins it sinks to the ocean floor angler fishes come in all kinds of shapes and sizes their trick is ingenious using the angling rod as a lure and every curious little fish becomes dinner many animals including ocean inhabitants communicate with a mixture of sounds and behavior everybody has to look out for their own survival in this metropolis of ocean inhabitants but it seems maybe not quite everybody does it by themselves [Music] the partner goby has come to an agreement with two pistol shrimps the goby keeps an eye on things while the shrimp's keep maintaining their hole larger rocks at the entrance are ideal for securing it they're an experienced team the shrimps keep in constant contact with the goby and even massage the fish's belly the goby will get nervous without these gestures from the shrimps the pistol shrimps need a cool and collected bouncer at their entrance teamwork this is where the anemone is settled with their poisonous tentacles whoever gets caught by those will pay for it dearly or lose their life no wonder that there is virtually no one who likes to settle here the little clown fishes are the only ones that know how to deal with these tentacles they cover themselves with the slime of the anonymous tentacles and are protected from the poison the clown's are safe in here and in return will protect their anemone as well as they can this seems like a sensible deal but on occasion the anemone will pull the tentacles inside its column shaped body which means the clownfish is home is gone when this happens they panic and look for another anemone that they can hide in for the time being unfortunately this one is already occupied and the next one as well and this means having to fight its current owner there's much to lose for the clown's without the anemone they can't procreate the clown fishes attach their eggs to the bottom of the column shaped footer their anemone hidden behind the poisonous tentacles both male and female tend to the eggs they found fresh water on them the eyes of the babies are already clearly visible the clown's are very protective of their eggs [Music] it takes the two of them to protect their offspring and only in conjunction with the anemone everybody in the reef has to take special care of their young if they don't it means their species will simply die out so it's not surprising that everybody gives it their best effort [Music] this triggerfish is hidden its offspring in a small Hollow in the sandy on floor and this means having to constantly protect this open excite on occasion they blow and fan the eggs but mostly they keep an eye out for predators this means grave danger one of the sea urchins is wandering straight towards the nest and the eggs have to be protected at all cost but how the triggerfish seems to consider the alternatives [Music] but then it blows and then rams the sea urchin again and again until it breaks the sea urchins guts spill out into the open a few more hits for good measure the danger has been averted [Music] everything else is easy two little damsel fishies cling to a coral branch a pretty and obviously inseparable pair they appear to have something important to do and there it is the female has been laying eggs and glued them to a coral branch over and over again both of them sweep past the eggs to keep them clean [Music] - very busy parents in the middle of town not far from them the same kind of damselfish but this one is feeding on the eggs not tending to them this damsel fish's priorities have changed its partner is gone and it's impossible to bring the eggs through by itself so it feeds on its own eggs - at least recycle the nutrients [Music] there are many different strategies to give one's offspring a good start some are surprisingly easy the mass mating of the black sea Bream's the males are so generous with their sperm that often a cloud of it will engulf the entire wedding party countless couples and constantly in motion a predator would have a hard time to find its bearings in this schooling behavior the fish's instincts cause them to mass mate in order to ensure the survival of their species cardinal fishes have their own clever means of child protection it's not time yet the couple are still flirting and courting with each other going around and around we'll leave them to it and take a detour to a couple not quite as gentle with each other monkfish is live in groups and their nests so very close to one another as a result all the fishes are alerted to a predator nearing their nests hermit crabs love to feast on the eggs of the monk fishes so the protective parents are all getting nervous [Music] the hermit crab is still far enough away and currently busy with something else the hermit crabs best defense is its house that it carries around for protection the patience of the monk fishes is wearing thin now everyone attacks in order to bowl the crab away from their nests they're clearly telling this hermit crab to take a hike but they should have stayed with their offspring because there's new danger approaching a gaggle of rainbow wrasses takes advantage of this unique opportunity and ravages the monkfish nests the predators are quick brutal and in the majority most of the monkfish eggs will be devoured an attack of this kind would never happen to the Cardinal fishes because they are mouth brooders and don't have to watch over a nest that's out in the open the male's carry the eggs in their mouths up to 20 thousand of them a mobile nursery they're safe here in their father's mouth unless of course he gets eaten [Music] during the night when it's dark the danger is greatest these underwater cities have a very active nightlife with special attractions basket starfishes come out and sit in the current it's a night active type of brittle star with their arms full of tiny little hooks they filter plankton out of the water to feed a very elegant feather star it's on the move to find a better spot to filter plankton this spanish dancer is even more graceful and elegant than the brittle stars it's a type of nudibranch the giant puffer fish is relaxed and spends the night dozing off on the sandy bottom others prefer the safety of their quiet bedroom the surgeonfish [Music] everybody settles in for the night as comfortably as possible the parrotfish tucks itself away in its mucus cocoon for protection against predators everybody's sleeping arrangements are different the poor triggerfish has to stand guard by its nest all night long there's no time to rest [Music] some of the Predators are quite soft footed a cone snail has spotted a small fish the snail is fast and the prey disappears in the blink of an eye the night is still young and still full of danger and terror these lion fishes pose danger to the cardinal fishes lion fishes suck in their prey even if they choke on it they're hanging around waiting for their chance [Music] this poor Cardinal is sideways in the lion fish's mouth eggs and all [Music] lion fishes aren't the most elegant predators with all their attachments and trade fins but this is all part of their camouflage they're harder to see and blend into the background outside the reef the lionfish is hunt as a school they drive their prey towards one another with their fanned out fins they prefer to attack from above cornering their prey this is not a different location just different light these special blue lights totally change the appearance of the reef [Music] now we can see that the coral polyps are bright red and they clearly stand out from their environment a new and fascinating perspective on the communication of many ocean inhabitants and suddenly an eruption of sorts it looks like smoke but in reality it's a type of reproduction a carpet anemone is ejecting its sperm in the blue light it looks like a dramatic eruption a hermit crab as a magic lantern the blue light brings out these colors an entire group of lion fishes on a food for a the animals don't seem to know any fear it seems that they're well aware of the poison they carry in their back spines they even used the light of our dive torches to their advantage there's no nightly rest to be had here with the first daylight new life comes in to the reef city [Music] they all seem to start going again ponderously with armored fins [Music] as pedestrians and as light and quiet as possible mother and daughter elegant and synchronous some have to hustle along on ten legs this spider crab runs straight into a brittle star gathering a giant smash up in the early morning wildly flopping around everybody tries to get away as in every city there are also shopping opportunities here [Music] this Moray Eel knows her shops well she rushes to her favorite store every morning the same with this blue spotted ray but they haven't opened yet it leans on Mont Finn as if to say it's waiting [Music] similar problems in a branch further up these sweet lips are also waiting to be tended to here they come a little late this morning the small cleaner wrasses are starting to open their shop and are hungry they're ready to rid their customers of parasites [Music] this Ray is also being served it likes to have its gills cleaned this is a barter business one side gets cleaned the other fed a very fair deal [Music] clown fishes seem to be excluded from this business because they can't leave their anemone in their case the cleaner fishes make house calls [Music] this snake eel is also otherwise engaged and the cleaner shrimps are also making house calls for him finally is the morays turn it has a lot of nutritious freeloaders on its skin and in its gills [Music] all of a sudden the cleaners leave why this Titan triggerfish is no better off the treatment has stopped before he was finished the cleaner fishes have new customers clients that have never come to see them before and they're now being preferred over old customers the point is that these new clients will like the service here so much that they will come back again the regular customers have to be patient and wait until the new clients are finished cleaner fishes operates solely according to economic rules this guy has also come for the first time and quite enjoys their service sometimes it's too much of a good thing though this small black spotted puffer just wants to look around and is not asking for a cleaning at this time it swims away quickly and clearly annoyed it's time to go back to the regular customers before they get impatient and leave for good digging deep where the gills are dirtiest one last time through the mouth and it's as good as new and the teeth squeaky-clean now this male Moray can start looking for a suitable female she is clearly not interested in male visitors this next dugout also does not look encouraging these two have already found each other a strange pair with the trigger fish's roommate they seem to get along just fine it's difficult to cut in as a stranger [Music] it would also be well advised to stay away from this giant triggerfish this on the other hand might be a different situation it's important to be patient [Music] this female Moray does not seem to be too reluctant she's showing her teeth which is not a sign of aggression quite the opposite she finally agrees to a date [Music] the two of them are getting to know each other moray eels are very gentle with their mates [Music] and they're good for another surprise as partners of a phenomenal hunting party these types of hunting parties have to find each other first in this big city the right place for the Maury and her partner the Maurice cooperate with the groupers it's not so far-fetched the grouper hunts in the open and the Moray inside the reef the Moray is able to get in between cracks and crevices that the grouper can't get two together they're a strong team a grouper that's trying to convince this Moray to hunt with him the grouper signal sister the Moray by rocking back and forth and shaking for all it's worth all for nothing this Moray doesn't understand and stays in its cave next dry maybe the Moray will react this time and swim with him again no luck finally this Moray seems to understand the grouper and his hungry the grouper tilts its head and the Mori accepts his invitation together they swim through the reef the Moray prefers to swim between the dark alleyways and the grouper decides it safer to stay on the Main streets around the reef this is not the right place the grouper expected to find scared prey here the Moray takes a break and waits it's not going to happen this way again another invitation to go they continue through the reef to another coral head also nothing for them here either the Mori is getting ambitious as well now and initiates a hunt on her own she might be better at finding hunting spots they're successful in this next coral head but then everything happens very quickly the fishes are panicked and both hunters are able to profit from that this coral city offers living space familiars many hideouts and crevices provide protection for everybody my home is my castle while some escape between sharp corals others curl up in a ball octopuses don't have bones under there for able to change shape their homes are usually very tight and space-saving [Music] they like to live a bit further apart from their neighbors because they're not necessarily always friends with one another [Music] it might be best to put up a wall of stones between them [Music] the ocean offers many hideouts which is synonymous with survival for many ocean inhabitants they can also be hideouts that nature never intended to be there such as this giant wreck 240 feet deep a research submarine on its way into the deep comes across a sunken freighter it's an artificial world with countless nooks and crevices to offer protection and a home for many ocean inhabitants the wreck has long been overgrown with all kinds of sea life the side of the hull has become a living wall made of corals and sponges son fishes with their odd form of movement patrol this area they're looking for jellyfish [Music] in steerage where the current is strongest filter feeders have found a new home such as these sea fan coral they feed on the tiny plankton particles a unit that has grown together made of technical man-made and organic structures even the steel anchor has grown a second skin made of living beings it offers these delicate creatures a solid structure to grow on [Music] they have all made a comfortable home in this sunken world not even the lights of the Stubb disturb any of the REC inhabitants new life has been created out of the tragedy of this sunken ship the ingenious life renewing cycle of nature the morays are sharing a home they seem to be exceptionally friendly towards one another even with this conga reel as their neighbor [Music] even the octopus remains unharmed by the mohr√≠s a unique environment made of steel that offers many different opportunities for ocean inhabitants to use it even this fishing net offers a conga yella place to hide the original destination of the sob is located a bit deeper a picturesque underwater city full of ancient amphora architecture an antique merchant vessel sank here only the clay containers once filled with Greek wine are still visible now they offer homes and protection to many ocean inhabitants similar to the reef hiding places are essential for staying alive down here the amphora have a very special shape they taper towards the bottom so they could be stored sitting upright in a layer of sand in the hull of the ship the amphora and their precious contents were safe during transport spiny lobsters welcomed these types of caves conger eels also feel safe in this mess of ham furry and shards of clay as if it was made for them and their slender long bodies the city of an furry on the ocean floor provides countless opportunities to observe disappear and be unseen maybe that's why this city seems to be very calm and orderly even when the conger eel swims above everybody's abode nobody panics because they only have to withdraw slowly into their homes under safe the same goes for this Forkbeard the conger eels only chance to make prey down here is to hide himself and ambush somebody the sunfish is also don't have much luck feeding here for the same reasons as the conga real on the other side of the globe the Spencer Gulf in southern Australia every year hundreds of giant cuttlefishes meet up to mate the rocky seabed offers great holes and caves to hide the eggs the females are smaller than the males and seem to be a bit shy keeping their arms tucked tightly together [Music] the males on the other hand present every bit of themselves openly to impress the females but also other males that are potential rivals when the going gets tough it's always a good idea to hide behind the safety of a cloud of ink [Music] without much success escape in Reverse only the strongest of them have a chance with the females he's a winner and courts his female by changing his color - interesting stripes she has agreed to mate with him and they hug tightly he deposits his sperm package into her mantle opening [Music] immediately afterwards she withdraws into one of the caves on the ocean floor in order to avoid courtship from other males a clear signal the male is protecting his female from other rivals [Music] but there's always the unexpected the so-called sneaker male tries to cut in this male is much smaller and pretends to be another female by acting like one very demure and shy all seems to be fine in the den he's busy chasing away other rivals from his new supposed female especially now that there are two females under his protection it can't hurt [Music] the two supposed females on the bottom below him are getting closer to each other the sneaker male and the female they mate in secret under the protection of the strong male as soon as the sneaker male is found out it gets dangerous for him but he has achieved what he came for and mated with this female the beatings are nothing compared to the glory of his success intelligent strategies and tricks are essential for survival underwater and part of everyday life a final dive into the magical world of sharks this spot on a sandbank close to the Bahama Islands has great attraction for these lemon sharks they come here by the hundreds and nobody exactly knows why this sandy plateau in the middle of the open ocean is easy for scientists to get to this experiment will show how sharks react to their own reflection the metal mirror stands upright on the seabed the animals that swim towards it will see their own reflection coming closer how will these lemon sharks react now the researchers have to have strong nerves things stay surprisingly calm the foreign object is almost ignored as if it had been there forever the Sharks either swim bastard or underneath it the scientists expected a bit more and soon the Sharks lose all interest in the mirror some sharks even calmly dropped to the seabed to rest [Music] the only ones alarmed by this behavior are the remoras that like to keep moving [Music] they let go of their shark and see if they can't hitch a ride with a more active individual shark hopping this one isn't a good choice either so they continue to yet another one all of a sudden something happens to the mirror and the peaceful afternoon on the sand bank changes quickly into the complete opposite the rope that the mirror is attached to loosens and the mirror falls over suddenly and seemingly out of nowhere several sharks rushed to the mirror and show great interest in it they smell and touch it and they get more and more excited what happened all of a sudden none of the scientists have any idea how to explain this change in behavior the animals that were calm and collected only a second ago are now completely out of their minds and the situation quickly escalates into a mass attack on the mirror but do they mistake their own reflection for an opponent it's time for the divers to leave because it's not safe anymore the communication of the ocean inhabitants continues to offer new and exciting insights that we will probably never fully understand
over the past 50 years 3000 ships and a hundred planes have gone missing in a mysterious stretch of water in the Atlantic Ocean one minute they are there the next they've vanished they all have one thing in common they all ventured into the Bermuda Triangle they are paradise destinations for tourists the Sunshine Coast of Florida and the Florida Keys the sun-baked island of Puerto Rico and the Bahamas and the beautiful coral seas of Bermuda but the surrounding waters hold a mystery that has been known by many names the devil's triangle the devil's seas graveyard of the Atlantic but one name given to these infamous waters strikes fear into the hearts of those who attempt to cross it the Bermuda Triangle the Bermuda Triangle lies off the eastern seaboard of the United States bordered by the Florida Keys Bermuda and Puerto Rico one and a half million square miles of empty ocean the Bermuda Triangle is a place where people disappear mysteriously that and it has no logical no conventional no natural explanation but many scientists believe there are logical explanations extreme weather rare magnetic anomalies affecting navigation and even gas bubbles rising from the ocean floor it is possible that bubbles from the ocean floor can sink a ship and yet the legends remain in places like Miami where Navy aircraft disappeared on a routine exercise that cost the lives of 27 men how can you lose five aircraft and the good questions the question that's still around today the Bahamas where one man claims to have travelled through time we experienced a spacetime warp of 100 miles in 30 minutes in Bermuda where strange occurrences are said to affect ships all my electronical instruments went they went haywire and over the vast Atlantic waters where pilots lose their reason the plane was shuddering and the instruments were gone and we didn't know what the hell was going on Miami the sunshine city beautiful beaches a watersports paradise it lies near the southeastern tip of the Bermuda Triangle on the coast of Florida Miami's beaches attract 11 million visitors a year it's a departure point for hundreds of cruise ships and flight over the Bermuda Triangle half a century ago another flight from here terrified two young naval men nineteen-year-old identical twins George and David Rothschild were flying home because of a sudden death in their family overreacted to the fact that we were going to go to our father's funeral the twins flew north from the Florida Keys over the waters of the Bermuda Triangle we've been flying for probably 20 or 30 minutes and all of a sudden the pilot yelled out the instruments are dead we have no more instruments and he became very frantic with the instruments malfunctioning the pilot had no idea where he was or even how much gas remained in the fuel tanks he said I'm afraid we're going to run out of fuel and he cowered to us please look out the starboard window what can you see look out the port window go back and forth so in the meantime the plane was shuttering and the instruments were gone and we didn't know what the hell was going on and he said can you see planes can you see ships down there can you see land anything please help us on this the pilot became panic-stricken the pilot said I'm too nervous I can't fly so the copilot had to take over and continue with the flight over water with fuel running low the twins were also getting desperate and we were looking for some hope something to see but we saw nothing all we saw was ocean we were over the ocean finally after what seemed like hours they spotted the coastline when we finally got to Norfolk and they landed then of course I was so happy I kissed the ground that dirt that we were on as a matter of fact Dave wouldn't fly in a plane for over 20 years laughter that that's really it yeah the flight took place a decade before the Bermuda Triangle earned its infamous reputation we had no idea what the Bermuda Triangle was or what the effect of the Bermuda Triangle was and later on we said that was it yeah we were there in that one that's what happened that's what affected our plane unfortunately we survived it the pilot of the rothschilds plane lost his nerve because his instruments malfunctioned or so he believed but could the vast expanse of the Bermuda Triangle have affected his mind perhaps in his moment of madness he believed the dials were broken because they weren't telling him what his mind was telling him one man who knows how such confusion can happen is flying instructor Robert grant it's all part of the mind playing games and you have to control it I've been flying over water for several thousand hours and when I get a long ways from Lyon the ears perk up you start hearing sounds in the airplane that you haven't heard since the last time you're over open water grant is an expert on spatial disorientation or vertigo the condition where a pilot loses his sense of up and down and left to right and starts to panic he flies over the Florida Keys the southeastern tip of the Bermuda Triangle here the afternoon heat haze can disguise with the sea ends and the sky begins we fly the airplane by outside references in our main outside reference that we fly by is the horizon we can determine pitch up pitch down left and right turn by looking out at the horizon and without the horizon things become very very difficult with the haze heavy haze in the summer especially here we can not differentiate between the sky and the water there is no horizon and that can lead to vertigo and the confusion of vertigo can cause a pilot to make completely irrational decisions let's take for instance your airplane is going in to say a right-hand turn your mind is telling you that you are actually going into a left-hand turn so if you don't believe the instrument and you believe your mind guess what happens you turn more right and the more right you turn the more vertigo sets in you no spatial or disorientation is another word that we use to describe that and it's it's hard to explain but let me tell you when it happens it's a very scary thing and vertigo unfortunately is kill people and if you don't recover from what's happening and believe your instruments and get the plane straight and level you end up crashing vertigo happens a lot more than we care to admit miss basis so could vertigo have been responsible for the confusion of the rothschilds pilot back in the 40s those those pilots were aligned solely on a magnetic compass and there was a certain amount of guesswork involved and I certainly take my hat off to it to those people that flew back then because they had a lot of guts to do what they did you get away from land and you're strictly relying on your compass for for Direction grant believes the confusion that can be develop islet over open water may explain some of the bermuda triangle disappearances well when you look at history we've we certainly lost ships and we've lost airplanes in the area called the Bermuda Triangle I call it the den of iniquity because you know it's just so easy to to get lost out there an average of five planes still go missing here every year but more than 50 years ago the Bermuda Triangle claimed that many aircraft in just one day Florida a magnet for Sun worshipers from around the world but in 1945 the beachgoers were military men and their wives from Naval Air stations dotted along the Florida coast although the Second World War had ended three months earlier millions were still in the Armed Forces memories of conflict were never far away and the air was filled each day with TBM Avenger bombers on training missions at the Naval Air Station in Fort Lauderdale rows of Avenger bombers stood ready but one training mission was to lead to the most perplexing Bermuda Triangle mystery of all flight 19 the lost Patrol a mystery studied for the past ten years by author Gian quizar it was a to 10:00 p.m. in the afternoon December 5 1945 five Navy TBM Avenger bombers took off from Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale for a routine training flight over the Atlantic the Avenger bomber was the Navy's largest single engine plane and more than able to handle the weather that day of broken cloud and 12 miles visibility as the five planes of flight 19 headed out into the Bermuda Triangle 14 young men were on board Navy fliers like these pictured at the base a few days earlier ironically the flight was a routine lesson in advanced navigation the route 316 nautical miles took them east over hen and chickens Shoals north over Bahamian islands and westwards back to the base a course that lay inside the Bermuda Triangle within half an hour they reached their target at Hanan chicken shoals and spent 20 minutes dropping practice bombs but on the next leg of the exercise an hour and a half into the mission the leader flight lieutenant Charles Taylor got into trouble he became completely confused neither of his compasses were working and he believed he was lost what did you learn compass read I don't know where we are we must have got that for the last turn what does your compass rate I am lost at present time I'm over small islands believed to be the Florida Keys the mission was familiar to naval photographer John Evans I had made the same flight that flight 19 made and there was just nothing it was very cinchy flight you go east nigga one turn then come back to the west how can you get lost radio operators ashore could hear the pilots but the lost pilots could barely hear their base I'm sure now that neither of my compasses are working with the planes burning 70 gallons of gas an hour the radio operators were helpless voyeurs to the deadly drama unfolding in the skies above the Bermuda Triangle light 270 degrees until we hit the beach run out of gas both planes fly close formation one plane for up to 10 gallons of gas both planes will land together we have no other land in sight by 6:00 p.m. with less than an hour's worth of fuel remaining the radio messages became more desperate we may have to ditch we may have been dead any minute we may have to ditch at four minutes past 7:00 a final faint radio message was heard what story Fox dari it was the callsign of planes from the Fort Lauderdale base then the radios fell silent with tanks drained of gas the five Avenger bombers must have ditched in the ocean the Navy procedure was that one of the planes got lost everybody ditched the whole flight ditch because it would be much easier to for the search-and-rescue people to pick these folks up the drills were constant on saving your life after you ditched you had flares you had my Mae West your life jackets on despite worsening weather conditions 242 planes searched for days for the missing man among the search team was Fort Lauderdale naval pilot David white the weather did get bad there was a front that came through the wind changed but for the first day we went out we expected to see them floating out here the TBM really was a good steady airplane you could land them in the water pull out the three-man life raft and not even get your feet wet the search covered more than a quarter of a million square miles of ocean but found nothing the flight never taught anybody's knowledge made it back to land no traces are found in an intensive search and that's basically the mystery how can five aircraft disappear on a very simple maneuver and there's simply no trace never found no way to really understand what happened so what could have happened to flight 19 many believe that with his compasses mysteriously not working flight leader Charles Taylor made a fatal and utterly inexplicable error Taylor saw land below him that he thought he recognized as being in the Florida Keys an area he knew well but almost certainly what he saw was an island 200 miles away in the Bahamas but even if Taylor did make such an error of further flight 19 mystery remains why would 13 other Airmen follow him into thousands of square miles of empty ocean he's the senior man you know he's got thousands of hours in the air and the students fill out follow the leader they that's their what they're taught to do what one or two of them didn't defect and say to hell with the driver be court-martialled than to die no one knows people say to me well what if you'd been a student and and you knew that he was wrong good question I probably would have headed west and gone back to Florida but the Bermuda Triangle had not yet had its fill of tragedy that day a flying boat involved in the search also vanished with 13 more men on board an explosion was reported but no wreckage was ever found the first official inquiry into flight 19 s disappearance blamed lieutenant Taylor the conclusion was that the flight leader became so hopelessly confused has to have suffered something akin to a mental aberration a later report cleared Taylor and concluded cause unknown rumors circulated that investigators had said it's as if they'd gone to Mars that's that's what it all started and that's when the people began to question how can you lose five aircraft and it's good questions the question that still is around today blame it on aliens from out of space or you can blame it on the stupidity of the pilot well of course I've heard the theories about they were taking up the Mars but I can't see any credibility to anything other than then he got lost and they landed in the ocean it should never have happened and that's what gave rise to all these feeling about the Bermuda Triangle or some alien or some mist came in or whatever it was more than half a century later speculation continues every December 5th at Fort Lauderdale they hold a memorial service for the missing men but now there are astonishing rumors that one plane had successfully ditched and that flight lieutenant Taylor could still be alive I heard about two and a half years ago that Taylor has survived did they pay the Bohemians picked him up and he was worried that he'd be blamed for it but that would give credence to the thought that why should I give I let them know I'm still alive I might be court-martialed and I think he would have been he finally married an island woman and I it's an interesting serie and then every time on the five December when they have the memorial service I look around for some guy about 78 79 80 and it's a incredible thing to think about it was the disappearance of flight 19 that first brought the Bermuda Triangle to the public's attention but the triangle was striking terror into the hearts of men centuries earlier new world explorers used to call this the Isle of Devils because of the awful screams and sounds that would emanate from the island and especially at night by the late 1950s the waters off the Florida coast were infamous it was rumored that those who ventured into the triangle disappeared without trace like the 14 young men of flight 19 the area was first called the Bermuda Triangle in 1955 since then many have attempted to explain the mystery for years one author has examined the facts behind each missing ship and plane and listed them all on his website he is Gian quizar I first started merely to document the Bermuda Triangle I was not setting myself up to solve it or to confirm any mystery I wanted to see if it was still going on kazar discovered that it is still going on the question is why what is so sudden that can cause a disappearance there it's hard to say that's why there's the great mystery of the triangle on average 60 ships and five planes go missing each year in these mysterious waters it's a mystery it's real-life mystery it's a real-life detective story and you're going to want to find the answer Bermuda the island that gave its name to the Bermuda Triangle it's a beautiful but remote island 650 miles from the American mainland across some of the world's most notorious waters some of the greatest mysteries have actually happened around Bermuda some of the biggest vessels like Sylvia loz 1976 was a five hundred, 90, foot vessel that apparently blew to pieces after she signaled herself 140 miles from Bermuda the cargo ship poet in 1980 after signaling north of Bermuda she vanished the weather was choppy but it was not enough to cause a five hundred, 20, foot vessel to sink without cause the island is a sub tropical paradise one-third the size of Washington DC fringed with the purest pink coral sands on earth each year the 65,000 population swells with half a million visitors most of them Americans arriving by cruise ship we just got married yeah newlyweds not on anyone I love it here I love the beach the waters gorgeous be they residents or visitor's they are all greeted by one of the islands most well known fixtures Johnny Barnes he's been here for decades and now he has a statue in his honor the offshore Bermuda reefs are home to a rich variety of undersea life 600 species of fish inhabit these waters it's a paradise for scuba divers although with a few species you don't want to mate unless they are safely behind glass the Bermuda aquarium is one of the islands most popular tourist attractions head of the aquarium is native born Bermudian Jennifer Grey Bermuda is the most beautiful place on earth because we're an oceanic island surrounded by pristine warm waters there's not a lot of poverty there's not a lot of crime it's just a very exquisite island in centuries past before the Bermuda Triangle gained its notoriety nobody wanted to land here it was a fearful place prior to colonization in the early 1600s new world explorers used to call this the Isle of Devil's because of the awful screams and sounds that would emanate from the island and especially at night and of course later when they colonized the islands they discovered that this noise was coming from the endemic how very rare bird that's known only to Bermuda and also pigs that had come off of shipwrecks not surprising then that young Islanders are raised on legends of the Bermuda Triangle I remember as a child myself being absolutely in awe of this this somewhat scary Bermuda Triangle or hole in space whatever it may be but of course visitors are often hearing about it for the first time and take it quite seriously planes disappear and ships disappear and you know all the stuff that you hear on television through movies but we're hoping that we're not going to be one of those subjects we don't want to disappear we want to enjoy that rest of our lives well I've heard that you know if you fly over the bureau triangle or get anywhere close enough for it yeah happen to disappear and no one ever hears from you again the island marks the northernmost point of the Bermuda Triangle and here it is also at its deepest we really are in very very deep water and and it drops off around us very steeply into nothing Bermuda is a remote coral reef perched precariously on top of a massive extinct volcano surrounded by the vast Atlantic Ocean more than a mile deep one man who knows these waters well is fisherman Sloane Wakefield and he has a wary respect for the surrounding seas the waters here you really have to know them you don't want to be caught in an area where there's reef and you're not sure where you are because a boat drawing any more than two feet of water will run aground to describe it in a nutshell it's treacherous Sloane and his crewman Mark Moran catch wahoo and mahi-mahi for local restaurants and Marlin for sporting fun so what we do when we're fishing is we run out to the edge what we call the edge which would be the side of the volcano and we troll along anywhere from 4,000 feet of water to 200 feet of water because that's how sheer the drop-off is the fishermen believe that some Bermuda Triangle disappearances can be attributed to natural causes like the weather because we are a dot in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean we get weather from everywhere and it can change in a heartbeat one minute we're looking at good weather in the next minute you got a low front coming through at one point this year we saw probably 15 maybe 20 foot seas out there and you know the boat meets like a feather on the wind on those waves but in these waters odd things can happen Wakefield has had one experience he still can't explain all my electronical instruments went they went haywire and once my instruments came back on I was completely heading in the other direction heading I was probably about four miles past where I was supposed to be a lot of people were saying oh you your instruments might have been shorting out they've never shorted out before that and they haven't shorted out since that's the encounter that I personally have had with what's called the Bermuda Triangle the waters known as the Bermuda Triangle lie between the subtropical resorts of Miami Bermuda and Puerto Rico thousands of tourists are attracted here from all over the world more than 800,000 crafts are registered in Florida alone along with countless other commercial vessels and visiting cruise ships these waters normally promise sunshine and calm seas but sometimes there are hurricanes Atlantic hurricanes are born off the African coast feeding on energy and moisture from the warm tropical waters the tracks of these storms reveal how over the past hundred years they head for America and how often they veer off towards the Bermuda Triangle at the National Hurricane Center in Miami the storms in the Bermuda Triangle are studied by meteorologists such as Jim leucine hurricanes are very frequent out in the Bermuda Triangle area there in fact the more hurricanes in that particular area than any other in the Atlantic Basin and the hurricane is a sailor's greatest fear the Mariner may not know which way to look sometimes the weather may be coming from one direction sometimes it may be coming from the other direction in November 2001 the media besieged the Miami weather center as Hurricane Michelle bore down on this corner of the triangle regardless of where Michelle liked to go as Michelle devastated the island of Cuba residents were ordered to evacuate the Florida Keys at the last moment Michelle weakened a little and swerved away into the Atlantic the whole of Florida however was lashed with rain as night fell and the downpour reached Miami tourists at South Beach celebrated their narrow escape with a hurricane party but even events on a smaller scale than hurricanes can be just as deadly thunderstorms thunderstorms are one plausible explanation for some of the mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle like the disappearance of an historic ship in 1986 the Pride of Baltimore vanished suddenly from radar screens 240 miles north of Puerto Rico the disappearance was a complete mystery then four days and seven hours later eight survivors were found they revealed that the ship had been hit by a microburst hundred mile an hour winds blasting from the bottom of a freak thunderstorm there were some very strong thunderstorms in the area but what happened was a very small scale microburst occurred right in the vicinity of this tall ship which was sunken in the downburst we think with unfortunately a great loss of life and that's that's what happens in these downbursts and those are probably responsible for some of the sinkings in the ocean and in the Bermuda Triangle but there are other even more unpredictable dangers in the Bermuda Triangle waterspouts some water spouts are tornadoes that move out to sea others are formed when rotating columns of air dropped from thunder clouds to whip up a vortex of spray the moisture condenses forming a writhing column connecting the sea to the clouds could these elegant but dangerous waterspouts account for some triangle disappearances one man who might know the answer is Jim Edd's a keen amateur fishermen who chases and films water spouts for fun it's going to be coming across the frame here really moving pretty good quick quick run well I'm always in search of that that the best waterspout footage I can get get up close on a boat film it from the air see the water coming up you get a little smarter and you get a little closer each summer monster waterspout in open water water spouts can be deadly particularly at night if you're out there at night and a waterspout develops it can flip your vessel over and if it's a tornadic waterspout the really big water spouts the strong ones ones a high velocity you may not see that you may get stuck in it you may you may hear it you may see you may feel the water spray ring around you but there's nothing you can do if you don't see it certainly you can't rule out the possibility of water spouts to explain the disappearance of ships in the Bermuda Triangle as a fisherman Edd's knows of other dangers within the Bermuda Triangle when you're offshore in this area one of the things you have to watch out for is what we call rips those are areas they're little Eddie's in the Gulf Stream that the jack up the waves a lot higher than what you're used to and especially if the wind is blowing against the current it can go from a two to three foot surf maybe to a five to six foot and when you get in there it's just like a washing machine so you really have to pay attention that you don't slide down and nose down into a wave disappearances have been reported out there for over 200 years before the modern mystery of the triangle probably the most famous is the USS Cyclops it was a 1918 she carried wireless she had 309 u.s. Navy crew aboard she was a u.s. naval Collier and she left British Barbados enroute to Baltimore and she never was seen again it just went down as the greatest mystery of the sea Woodrow Wilson the president said only God in the sea knows where the great ship has gone the Bahamas a necklace of islands that lie in the Atlantic Ocean a hundred miles from the Florida coast here the weather and the waters can be deceptively beautiful what's interesting about the disappearances in the Bahamas is that the Bahama Bank is no more than 50 feet shallow and yet no ship no aircraft has been found on the bottom no trace has ever been found of those that disappeared the Bahamas attracts four million visitors each year nearly half the population work in the tourism industry boating is one of the most popular attractions among the 700 islands only 23 of which are inhabited the main danger around here is the Bahamas is a very beautiful place and people often get a false sense of security in terms of the danger that they may face we have cold fronts that sweep across from Florida and in a matter of an hour can change the weather from just the perfect day to an absolute nightmare it often means coastal boating can be quite dangerous vessel hailing Mayday this is Bahamas air sea rescue now soar captain what is the nature of distress in your location over helping ships in distress in this part of the triangle is the job of the Bahamas air-sea rescue Association their volunteer sailors see many baffling cases but believe most are caused by human error Bermuda Triangle level is being fascinated with it people disappear all the time it's easy to die out there especially when there's no help my own opinion is that although you don't know exactly what happened in every case I think almost every case is explainable by human error I mean there are so many ways to get yourself killed on the seat to assume every time someone is missing is due to a mysterious factor I believe is stretching in but you never know but perhaps there are forces other than wind waves and weather affecting the triangles waters at the Bermuda underwater exploration Institute are thousands of artifacts raised from the ocean depths they come from shipwrecks scattered around the islands reefs but visitors also discover that scientific theory has a part to play in explaining the disappearances of the Bermuda Triangle the Institute's director is Ralph Richardson there are some scientific theories about the Bermuda Triangle one includes the large pockets of gas which because of seismic activity and so on escape from the oceans bottom scientists have discovered that huge bubbles of methane gas can violently erupt without warning from the ocean floor you can imagine a ship sailing through sailing on the ocean and a large pocket of gas just surrounds it the ship then loses its buoyancy and disappears from sight without warning that is one of the theories of the Bermuda Triangle at least one oil rig is thought to have been sunk by a methane gas eruption but nobody knew whether the bubbles could actually sink a ship at sea Bruce DiNardo an expert in fluid dynamics at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey California is now researching just how dangerous those bubbles can be let's imagine the body that's floating in water the reason it's floating a body that's heavier than air is that the greater you depth you are the greater the pressure so a body along its bottom is going to feel this greater pressure and the pressure will keep it floating if you add bubbles you lower the density of the water the bubbles take up space the volume of the water will expand but the mass of the water stays the same so the buoyant force will decrease as I increase the amount of bubbles the ball will sit deeper in the fluid and eventually we get to a critical point where the ball sinks now what might happen in the ocean is that there is a burst of bubbles we can show that here I just turn on and turn off the air you can see that the ball sinks if this were a ship and it took on enough water they would sink to the bottom and stay there in the ocean there is something like a methane eruption the source of bubbles will be localized they will rise but there'll be water outside where there are no bubbles but the fact that we can it can sink there is from to me that's proof that have ship can sink in the ocean I don't need to say I wouldn't even say theoretically but it is possible that bubbles from the ocean floor can sink a ship methane gas eruptions may account for some missing ships but they can never answer all the questions I believe we will solve it eventually so long as we don't deny that it does go on but there is one story of the Bermuda Triangle that seems to defy every rational explanation a tale that if true would bend the very laws of nature the waters of the Bermuda Triangle infamous and mysterious but do more ships and planes vanish here than anywhere else on earth what sets the triangle apart from other oceans is that there is a higher number of disappearances of both ships and aircraft in the area there are other sections of ocean where there is comparable traffic where there where the coastguard answers an equal number of May days but in the Triangle there is a greater proportion of disappearances where nothing is found there is no SOS usually there's no electronic Maydays issued there's no trace found in most instances and those disappearances has spawned some fantastic theories there are those who believe that UFOs from outer inner space are kidnapping people there are those who believe that the electromagnetic phenomena are capable of causing dimensional transmutations and time warps time tunnels they're all reported out there one of those time discrepancies is said to have happened here in the Bahamas property developer Bruce Gernon has been flying to and from here for more than 30 years but no flight was his strange as the one he made with his father on the 4th of December 1970 father and son planned to fly from Andrews town Airport in the Bahamas heading more than a hundred miles across the sea to Palm Beach the weather was fine as they took off just after 3 p.m. the first unusual thing that I saw that day was a lenticular cloud that was hovering over the Great Bahama Bank at least 60,000 feet high and my airplane wasn't capable of flying over it it was very intense with huge flashes going on rapidly at a random pace I noticed an opening in the clouds like a huge huge shape opening but as I approached it the top of the opening closed and it became a horizontal tunnel it appeared to be between 10 and 15 miles long and when the aircraft entered the tunnel these lines appeared and they were rotating counterclockwise it was difficult to keep it level and concentrate on the other end of the tunnel which was aiming directly for Miami Gernon says he emerged from the tunnel to find it closing behind him his airplane soon became engulfed in a peculiar mist I checked my instruments and they didn't appear to be working well he claims that once inside this mist the airplane disappeared air traffic control he says could no longer see him on their radar screens we were caught inside this strange fog with the instruments malfunctioning and air-traffic control are unable to help us and then the air traffic controller came back on the radio screaming that he had an airplane directly over Miami Beach I looked at my watch and we had only been flying just over 30 minutes so we should still be at least 80 or 90 miles away from Miami Gernon landed at 3:48 p.m. landed in Palm Beach and the flighted took only 45 minutes and I'd made that flight dozens of times before and it always took about an hour and 20 minutes sometimes it an hour and a half Gernon has never been able to come up with a rational explanation for how he made the flight so quickly but despite the skepticism of others he has never stopped searching for an answer well after researching it for many years I have come to the conclusion that we experienced a space-time warp of 100 miles in 30 minutes just didn't make sense until I started researching a time and what it can do in the Bermuda Triangle the flight changed garnon's life he is now writing a book about the experience Miami Bermuda Puerto Rico and the Bahamas are all popular tourist destinations attracting travelers from around the globe most enter and leave the Bermuda Triangle in safety but still the mystery remains pilot error water spouts hurricanes rip tides thunderstorms time warps and disorientation all possible explanations for this seemingly inexplicable mystery the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle

Peter ward for help peter is a paleontologist and an expert on the origins of this creature he has decades of experience in these waters and there's no substitute for local knowledge so Bob will get some maps of the underwater area we're going to go see you tomorrow oh nice thing about this these are really high quality side-scan sonars and they give images in great detail from these we can pick out caves or dens really where the creatures that we seek can be found face to face with my camera haha whatever Bob's been filming underwater for more than 30 years he's one of the best at very difficult diving it's a rebreather a closed-circuit rebreather the co2 carbon dioxide has pulled out add a little oxygen it comes back and you breathe it the same as the guys who walked on the moon real cool I can stay down there with the creatures and film them for as long as I can stay on the cold the water registers 47 degrees without a dry suit a diver could slip into unconsciousness from the cold in just half an hour what if a super same zipper they use in spacesuits only a spacesuit I think they pressurize it in this too you get vacuum pack you all these fancy lights think that one means low get a little warm gotta get in the water soon [Music] these gloomy green depths are called the Emerald sea and although cold they are rich in oxygen and nutrients the combination allows creatures to reach enormous size [Music] down at 60 feet Bob and Peter picked up a trail of broken and discarded shells a dead giveaway something strong and very hungry has come this way and often the crab should show more caution it's up against a devious and determined predator [Music] [Music] as Bob approaches his quarry appears to have found him [Music] a Giant Pacific octopus eight arms of sinewy muscle lined with grasping suckers reach out and gently explore the strange in truth [Music] a giant can reach 20 feet from arm tip to arm tip and weigh in at 200 pounds it's the largest octopus in the great clan called the cephalopods the group that unites the octopus and squid it's an ancient tribe the first large predators in the sea to this curious female we're a brand-new species [Music] cephalopod means head footed a good beginning and deciphering the octopus's amazing design the head and body are encased in a large soft sack and the foot derived from its distant relatives the clams and snails has become a siphon a water jet to propel it in any direction a long time ago its ancestors were a shell but the octopus has given that up yet for creatures with such tasty flesh the lack of protection presents a problem the cephalopod solution the most extraordinary skin in the animal kingdom in an instant it can change color pattern and texture and with no bones to confine its shape the creature can virtually disappear [Music] another female lies sequestered in her den tending to her brood of eggs she lays up to a hundred thousand just once in her life when they hatch she will die these clever curious creatures won't live long at all their entire lifespan is no more than three or four years the transparent babies are no bigger than a grain of rice but within a year they'll be giants [Music] while the lives of these complex beings are all too brief their line reaches back 500 million years long before sharks began swimming the Seas let's be a great spot right in here Peter Ward has spent 35 years delving into cephalopod family secrets he's brought Bob to a special outcropping of rocks they were once well submerged in a much warmer sea and still hold a record of that long ago time fossils are found in these rocks fossils of relatives of the octopus actually they're called ammonites and how old are they 80 million years an age 80 million years stir that is old back in those days cephalopods made beautiful curved shells if you dig long enough hard enough you can find some beautiful stuff this is an ammonite it's a fossil that is actually the direct ancestor of octopus so this is a cool an ancient cephalopod is related to the chambered nautilus so the tentacle sat here - swam about a shell is a mobile home and a defense against predators but it's so cumbersome it makes swimming difficult of the almost 1,000 kinds of cephalopods alive today only the Nautilus still wears one it's a living fossil puffing along the reefs of the Indo Pacific as though nothing has ever changed Bob returns for one last dive with the octopus [Music] I couldn't resist bringing her a treat all cephalopods are carnivores and they love crabs this creature actually reached out to me I could sense her interest her intelligence I could see it in her eyes there's something about the eyes of these animals just draw human observers in and especially with the octopus and the cuttlefish they definitely make visual eye contact with you and maintain it dr. John Forsythe studies these creatures amazing physiology and complex behaviors and I've come in and played games with octopus we're all duck down they'll raise up and look at me and then I'll raise up and they'll duck down and this will just go on for 15 or 20 minutes like this guy I can barely see him over there but I look up yeah see he's coming up because I think they look for our eyes I think they try to make contact with our eyes as well and I think that's what draws us into watching these animals whereas a fish sometimes I look at a fish and I'm not sure where it's looking they just have these blank cold stares but with a cephalopod it's really never like that at the National Resource Center for cephalopods in Galveston Texas John maintains quite a collection you there are several kinds of octopuses a school of small squid and another relative the cuttlefish for John the eyes of a cephalopod are not just the windows to its soul they tell you a lot about how the animal lives the octopus has a rectangular pupil that captures light reflected off the seafloor squids large round eyes are adapted to seeing darting prey in the twilight of the open ocean cuttlefish well in both worlds and their complex eyes can actually change shape to accommodate their travels but it's not in their eerie eyes that cephalopods reveal their inner feelings it's in the remarkable skin millions of tiny sacs of pigment called chromatophores dot their skin each controlled by minut muscles with a little flexing a cephalopod can flash with rippling bands of color [Music] any sort of excitement danger desire aggression passion and their skin lights up [Music] for creatures with no vocal abilities at all this is the way they communicate in a language of light and color and like an octopus a cuttlefish can transform its texture matching its surroundings hiding in plain sight given their camouflage capabilities it's no wonder we're still learning just how many kinds there are [Music] one of the hotspots for new discoveries is the narrow lembeh strait of north sulawesi in the island chain of indonesia the pre scenic spot John and Bob have come here looking for new species of cephalopods it's a place primed for strange adaptations in the shallow warm water light and temperatures remain constant but the channels inlets bays and lagoons create many small separate habitats and that leads to high diversity this is John's fourth trip to lembeh strait and each time something surprising turns up he's brought Bob to a spot called Rita clari which in local slang means the muck [Applause] [Music] at first glance it's a vast flat disappointment but wait here quietly and a lot of what looks like sand begins looking back [Music] from the still of the muck to the roaring straights a lot of effort goes into not standing out drifting reeds are actually floating razorfish and the end of a few branches turn into ornate ghost pipefish [Music] out in the high-speed tides and swirling Eddie's fish work hard to keep their footing digging into the bottom with spine like fins but even creeping along on the seafloor you still have to make a living a harmless looking weed rolling in the current is a hairy frogfish trolling for a meal it comes equipped with its own strange lure [Music] [Music] [Music] the sand offers the best retreat but the crab has already been spotted a margin ated octopus is the perfect little predator here good camouflage good eyesight good grip the soft bodied octopus has one more weapon of its sleeve to subdue the crabs claws venom it finds a chink in the crabs armor injects a neurotoxin and the struggle is over [Music] in such an open setting the trick for every creature is to find someplace to hide an octopus fits in just about anywhere and John finds one tucked into a piece of discarded pipe perhaps there is something in cephalopod memory that recalls having a shell Bob and John find this little octopus ambling along with a dark brown bottle tucked under his arms the bottle turned out to be his home and he took it with him everywhere so I thought I'd offer him a new fancy place and see if he's interested in trading spaces [Music] I began to worry he might get confused by this clear glass and wouldn't remember how to get back out but after a few minutes he slipped through the opening and went straight back to his old brown bottle he'd made his choice I think the clear glass was a little too bright and besides there's no place like home especially when you can take it with you [Music] in the husks of old coconut shells they find the pearl like eggs of one of John's favorite creatures it's a tiny cuttlefish that seldom seen after it hatches it remains so small and well camouflaged that it takes great practice to find it down on the sea floor it appears to walk across the bright stones its rippling colours blending in and standing out it's called the flamboyant [Music] the flamboyant cuttlefish is really in a class by itself even among sulla pods in a lot of ways first of all the vibrant dynamic bright colors the brilliant yellows the magentas the pinks and browns it adds on top of that these passing clouds of color as it's stalking looking for prey and of course that's happening in living skin [Music] a lot of these animals are surprisingly bold the flamboyant actually seems to like being under the lights it begins hunting as soon as we start filming my video lights attract little shrimp and crustaceans perhaps the cuttlefish can even see better in the lights as well it's only when John sticks out an enormous hand that we see the scale of this little hunter next to a 6-foot Humboldt and a giant octopus it's hard to believe it's one of the family not far away a small octopus has been eyeing the scene John reaches out for a better look every time I touch one of these animals I'm not gripping it or holding it my intention is never to frighten the animal in any way however I am trying to keep it close to where I can get a good look but at the same time the animal knows at any moment it can get away if it wants to [Music] this octopus gets away all too soon John thinks it may be a brand new species never seen before [Music] I don't know Bob I'm not sure what that is but it could be a new one I think it could be a new species I wasn't expecting to see that it's not something you seen before no no I'm not sure what that would be it's a cool little critter a while the waters of Sulawesi are full of new discoveries and one is an octopus designed with a special brand of disguise it lives in the same waters as the banded sea snake whose bold stripes announce its potent venom these are banded arms that can make the same impression when disturbed the octopus flashes and intensifies the stripes becoming a sea serpent coiled and deadly [Music] the creature has not yet been named by science but it is known to be a fraud it's a shy nocturnal octopus and unlike the snake its venom is virtually harmless it stripes are simply a ruse to intimidate would-be predators the real killer is a delicate jewel toned creature the blue-ringed octopus the flashing blue neon is no false alarm it's poison can immobilize every muscle in the human body there is no antidote but all it's really after is a crab [Music] [Music] the blue-ringed is notorious along the coast of Australia but it's one of dr. mark Norman's favourites as curator of marine invertebrates at Museum Victoria his fieldwork in all seven seas has revolutionized what we know about cephalopods it's really hard to estimate how many species of kefla pods or in particular octopuses we have worldwide because we're still in the period of discovery they thought there was about a hundred species of octopus in the world and we found 150 new species in the last 10 years through the Indian and Pacific Oceans in Australia and up through Asia and these groups of animals it's not hard to find new species almost everything we touch is new Bob wants to get close to the blue-ringed in the wild so mark is a shortcut to the beach yep it's a great place to click crabs through the graveyard a yep so are these the bodies of the people who have been bitten by blue ringed octopus very few people with not blurry parts he's more likely to die choking to death on his calamari meal at the local pub so this is where the crabs live yep they hide up here at low tide under the rocks as the guide to the blue-ringed mark starts bob off with their prey lots of little crabs yeah need a nice juicy one there you go do the clues on that that'll take your eye off it's an iron back crab fufu you can appreciate why the octopus has to get rid of the crabs claws as quick as possible knock them out when the octopus bites them it actually goes for those soft gaps in the junctions like the elbows whether the armors a bit thinner or also by tomorrow Don the eyeball and the poison goes straight down the eyeball and into the brain so they end up paralyzing the animal instantly and putting these claws out of action [Music] the dive begins after dark when blue rings are most active and it's not off some wild remote beach the deadly blue ring lives just beneath the town Peter [Music] blue-ringed octopus are extremely venomous animal and if I was to be bitten I would probably be dead within three minutes your body would start stiffening up and you'd lose the capacity to breathe you'd lose the capacity to wave or walk or run away you'd run out of oxygen and you'd suffocate but these little animals are really shy really secretive and the last thing they want to do is attack humans they don't eat human so that dragged people out of their cars and dragged them down the beach they just feed on crabs but tonight not even a crab could catch its attention this is a male and he's just found a female two wild blue rings are preparing to mate [Music] they keep their colors subdued to avoid attracting attention especially from competing males no flashing their electric blue a temporary aquarium helps Bob film what happens next after a few minutes of courtship the male gently slips a special arm into the female's Gill slit he's depositing a packet of sperm which she will use later to fertilize her eggs it's the end of their relationship and most likely the end of his brief life that was all he needed to accomplish [Music] just beneath the very same pier is another cephalopod almost never seen in shallow water new research finds that they to pack a poisonous punch but their bright little stripes have earned them a harmless nickname The Pajama squid I think these careful pods are the closest to the cartoon characters they're little black and white suits and their little frilly lashes behind their eyes and yellow on the top of the eyes they're just straight out of a comic book [Music] The Pajama squid seemed to have taken a cue from the blue rings miles grab any passing female and then they try as hard as they can to reposition them so that they're faced on ready to make sort of suckers to suckers [Music] the mating season is also picking up off Australia's southwestern coast in one small bay giant cuttlefish have begun to assemble they leave deep water and enter the shallows once a year for three to four weeks [Music] the males are three feet and massive with eight flowing arms and one all-consuming purpose [Music] a much smaller female takes refuge in the rocks the male's waste no time taking on their rivals they flash and ripple with aggression their control is so subtle that they can isolate and flex just the flank facing the opposing male the other flank communicates a solid dependable side to any nearby female one male has claimed her and takes possession he'll guard her now keeping her beneath him until she is ready to lay her eggs jewels around here somewhere bob is heading for this far-flung coast but before diving with these giants he needs to brush up on the subtleties of cuddlefish communication this is a crazy place to meet a scientist Julianne Finn is a leading expert on the intense social dynamics of the cuttlefish he comes to this junkyard to scrounge up special equipment for an interesting experiment hey Jules I've read Bob okay oh yeah yeah it's uh you end up with cars oh yeah I love them I got I got a number of old cars and plenty of treasures in this place cuttlefish speak a visual language and Julian wants in on the conversation also I got a few ideas about making something to use on this cuttlefish and ylr trying to get a bit of a different shot so looks like junk to me meanwhile the cuttlefish continue to gather [Music] they're complex communication escalates into a kaleidoscope of colors opponents toss each other in the rolling tide and things start getting rough the violence can rip up their all-important skin sabotaging a male's chance to impress and intimidate and someone's nursing a torn off tentacle in a temporary standoff a large male guards his female from two other heavyweights while a little male too small to take seriously hovers on the sidelines the two males on shore get set to join the fray well here you go Jules I just wanted you to know that my camera's bigger than yours one's a bit different than yours er well yours has a hubcap on the front what I'm hoping to do is fill the male's reaction to another male and instead of having another male there I'm going to have its reflection it's when males are the same size that trouble starts and Julian will present one with it's very own reflection he's studying the displays and the intense competition he intends to provoke a fight he approaches a large male who immediately responds the cuttlefish becomes increasingly absorbed with his own image but instead of a conflict the story takes a surprising turn the small unimpressive male has sneaked in and begun mating with the unguarded female he's not signaled nor flashed nor dazzled he simply grabbed the female for his own making every attempt to look as much like her as possible the aggressive male makes no headway with the mirror and finally moves off to resume his duties but he's still distracted still flashing and doesn't recognize that his female is mating right under his nose the little male looks so like another female he doesn't see the threat at last he senses something's wrong and moves in to reclaim his female to re-establish their relationship he presents her with the gift of a crab [Music] with so much going on in cuddlefish Society Julian will be experimenting for a long time to come [Music] Julian's attempt to interact with the cuttlefish and crack their code has given Bob a daring but dangerous idea deep in the waters of Mexico the mighty Humboldt squid flash their own mysterious signals and Bob is determined to dive with them again he intends to engage these aggressive predators by imitating their behavior with a display all his own mark Normand and julien fin think he's close to crazy sure you've got the blurring octopus that can kill you within a few minutes with the poison yet there's something scarier about a squid that can rip off your flesh and tear out your throat so to speak I think you'd be really sensible to work with shark cages with those animals because the stories I've heard under these massive animals that will effectively skeletonize a cow in a minute because they're such voracious predators [Music] Bob Cranston has no intention of taking this advice his whole goal is to interact with these squid on their terms in their world in the small town of santa rosalia on the edge of the Sea of Cortez being a fisherman takes a certain courage every other year so we some guys have friend that they file floating in the ocean last year and I select they found him because we are the carnivorous they'll eat you honey they will eat you is clearly the squid will eat you if you fall into the ocean they'll get you to the tentacles you'll drown and then they'll hear all the rest of all to teach you [Music] despite their dread these fishermen face the Humboldt on a nightly basis Bob will need their help if he hopes to find when and where the squid are rising Alberto when the Humboldt flash on and off Bob intends to flash right back you'll know say this is a flashlight big flashlight for squid we're gonna this is loco si Bob knows perhaps better than anyone just what Humboldt are capable of [Music] but it's not fear that he feels it's an intense fascination for such alien creatures in a world so different from our own for me there's just something about these animals maybe it's because this type of diving in itself is a great challenge it's hard to work at these depths I've managed to go down and physically touch these fantastic creatures but somehow they're the ones that have taken hold of me he's 12 miles from shore aside from his assistant cameraman there'll be no backup down below and no source of help at all topside there's not so much as a radio on this little boat these are small boats is a big ocean there's a language barrier between me and a fisherman who think I'm crazy to dive in the water anyway if I disappear and drift away from this boat the fishermen will just think the squid ate me and they won't even bother coming to look for me yet bob has confidence in his own experience and in his plan I've made up this light tube and filled it with strobe lights the idea is that the Humboldt squid flash for communications they flash at each other they flash at the divers and so I hope to elicit some kind of a reaction from these animals with this light tube beneath the boat lies a thousand feet of open water and sea monsters [Music] [Music] Bob descends his homemade lightsaber a beacon in the utter darkness right away there's a complete surprise mobula rays they're seldom seen in a school like this already the night has taken on unexpected possibilities with his depth gauge reading 150 feet Bob figures he's in squid waters he powers up [Music] [Music] a giant swarm of pink krill mobs the lights suddenly Bob's in the middle of a midnight feeding frenzy [Music] then rocketing up from below Humboldt squid they're flashing red and white Bob tries to get clear of the krill into better visibility and he's caught the squids attention [Music] I'm transfixed by this enormous eye up from the deep I can sense this creature thinking but I can't imagine what [Music] a minute later contact the squib grabs hold testing the light the only way it can the feel of hard plastic must come as a surprise and it circles me as though curious then it comes back for more this time the aggression is gone it just seems interested amazing we play for a moment then suddenly it's over [Music] the fishermen are relieved just to see me alive but I climb back in the boat knowing something remarkable has just happened I danced with the devil down in the deep and I'm already thinking about the next time it's certain that Bob will return to dive again with the mysterious Humboldt perhaps with a new strategy on how to make contact he's just at the beginning of this extraordinary quest
hey what's up everyone welcome to our first episode of a brand new podcast we have a couple of marine biologists here with me Eric Austin Yee and Caitlin Taylor hey everyone hello and we have myself a marine wildlife photographer my name is Slater Moore we were hanging out last night watching the movie and we decided that be a cool idea if we could all get together once a week and create a podcast that's kind of based on whale watching marine biology maybe photography and just some topics related to the ocean so here we are and let's jump right into this go for it alright so we decided our first topic would be whale watching along the California coast and we didn't put any bold points under that so we don't know where this is gonna go but we think maybe we can start off by talking about maybe the best time of year to go whale watching here in California alright so we'll have Eric talked about his whale watching experiences in the Southern California Orange County range and maybe we can have Caitlyn talk about her experiences in the Monterey Bay Eric what do you think about well washing along the California coast California coast well as far as Southern California goes where I was based up for a while weather I mean you can't beat the wetter and ocean conditions now that I worked up and down the coast I wore flip-flops shorts t-shirts pretty much year-round in Southern California the ocean is a lake compared to where I work now as far as siding goes I can definitely see a difference so you often get asked when is the best season summertime especially the last few years we've really seen an increase of humpbacks in the area and then during the fall you really do get this lull where you're just looking forward to seeing common dolphins but you're you're bigger cetaceans you know here your humpbacks and your blue whales are kind of a little thin during the fall but once it starts cooling down the gray whales really start picking up so that's one thing I noticed about Southern California but I'm sure Caitlyn can talk about other parts of California where it seems like there's more consistant sightings year-round so what I would say first of all about Monterey Bay is any day could be the best day to go whale watching we're pretty darn spoiled in Monterey Bay we do get whales year-round most companies actually guarantee a sighting year-round which is pretty crazy there's not really any other place on earth like that there's definitely Peaks though and one of the slower times that I've experienced in the last five years which is a little biased because it's changed a lot in the last 10 years is June can be kind of slow it can be incredible but it also can be pretty slow and the weather can be pretty rough and the humpback is kind of settle in check in in May April and May and then they they disappear in June and come back in July and really hang around till late October early November give me a little bit of a gap in no vendor November depending on when the gray whales decided to start showing up then the gray whale is a pretty consistent end of December all the way through March and April and May can also be the best time to see killer whales blue whales it really depends on the year some years they're here in March and then they're here to stay some years there's a big pulse for they show up for three weeks in May and then you don't see them the rest of the season just depends on the krill but any day could be your NatGeo day where you saw ten species of cetaceans four other species of mammals you saw killer whales punching a dolphin in the air you just never quite know what's gonna happen and it's it's pretty awesome to have that possibility any day well both of those places aren't definitely so my favorites to photograph whales and dolphins yeah we got to keep in mind too that you know you'll read field guides or text books they'll tell you will show up this time of year in this area but you know the animals don't have these field guides they dote and without relations growing some of them yeah - yeah I know I mentioned how back in Southern California though humpbacks were usually a summer thing but I'm you know looking at some of our fellow whale watchers down in Southern California right now or you know literally today I think you know saw humpbacks even the ocean side you see that yeah the last two days have seen humpbacks so you just never know out there what's gonna happen I think the waters also stayed kind of warmed it's you basically as long as the weather's good it's pretty much a good time to go whale watching in California you might not always get a bigger baleen whale in the Southern California part of the coast it might just be some common dolphins or maybe Pacific white-sided dolphins during the winter months but you never know if you don't go out there you won't see anything so it's definitely uh always a good time to go and since it's great well season going on right now and it's actually kind of the heart of it maybe we can talk about gray whales migrating along the California coast and how it can differ from the Monterey Bay versus Southern California maybe how they act and yeah just the whole migration cool one thing that I've noticed I think I think all three of us have discussed this was the activity level of the gray whales we do know gray whales are pretty slow you know traveling in single digit speeds all the time and here we pretty much just see them traveling yeah they definitely don't stop run around and play or play around as much as I've noticed they do in Southern California yeah but there's a northbound migration we do see them get frisky out here but as far as like breaching and spyhopping goes I remember seeing that a lot more down south I really really don't know what it is I'm just wondering if they're being a little bit more stealthy coming through the Monterey Bay area you know think they can feel that maybe the water temperatures getting a little warmer maybe or maybe they've had previous incidents with some of our you know pigs out here or something like that so pigs are transient killer whales for those of you who don't know stealth mode what do you think Caitlin's been in Monterey for what five years now what I tell people is on the south by southbound migration they're very business-oriented when they're in Monterey they're still far enough away from the party that they're like we gotta go and that seems to be you know their behavior oftentimes you don't see them breaching we don't see em stopping to roll around they're just like they gotta get down the coast on the southbound migration on the northbound migration that's when you get friendly gray whale encounters you see them rolling around with each other sometimes you see maytee well courtship going on plays I don't know if they're actually mating but they're showing off well you can definitely tell you're not showing the pink floyd there and on the northbound migration if you're watching them from shore like in Big Sur and you're up above them a lot of times you'll see them stop and play in the kelp or just pace back and forth on the shore a lot and they don't really seem to be in a hurry at least until they get to Monterey Bay once they're crossing point Pinos on the northbound migration they're almost impossible to watch they start snorkeling there keep a very low profile it's really hard to even even without a calf that adults are like not messing around once they get past point P nose on their way up to the to the other side of the bay and I think that the gray well migrate northbound part of the gray whale migration along the Southern California coast is probably one of the best places to watch the gray whales being that there's a lot of beaches with open just sand and no rocks and these gray whales love to stop and kind of roll around maybe if they have their young a calf you see them practicing like boo and see control and stuff like that blowing bubbles and just all sorts of cool stuff so it's in my opinion one of the best places to watch the northbound part of the gray whale migration is definitely the Southern California coast that doesn't mean it's bad to go whale watching in Monterey or central California during this time it just means you're gonna be seeing a completely different behavior from the gray whales and you might also be seeing a killer whale predation among these gray whales and Caitlyn has definitely seen plenty of those so maybe she can talk a little bit about what that is yeah so the reason why even the adults do not like stop and play around in Monterey Bay on the northbound migration is because Monterey Bay is one of the first deepwater obstacles they have to cross when they're a calf with their mom they're only about 3 maybe 4 months old when they're coming through the bay and it's very deep water and it's very deep water close to shore so it gets a little tricky because there's some very intelligent animals out there known as killer whales we see transient or bigs killer whales most often in Central California especially Monterey Bay because of that deep Canyon it they seem to use it as a trap so the killer whales have figured out that if they can isolate a mom and calf out over the middle of the canyon there's no escape because the the mom wants to run near shore with her calf and try and escape from the killer whales so they get in really shallow water they almost beached themselves and then they can rest and they can the killer whales will give up but the killer whales know that if they can sneak up on the gray well mom and calf pair in deepwater then there's no escape and they eventually will separate the calf from the mom and eat the calf we have seen escapes sometimes the gray whale mom does a really good job hustles all the way into Shore for several hours but I have seen my fair share of successful hunts as well and it's pretty traumatizing sometimes the mom even just like pouts and like will lay upside down for 15 minutes or will charge around charge it boats charge at the killer whales sometimes they take off so quick you forgot they were there and a lot of gray whales do have scars from encounters with killer whales at some point in their life yeah I mean me having worked in the south and now coming to the Norfolk it's yeah it's two different worlds for the northbound migrations it's kind of crazy I remember down south I mean you would see these moms and calves playing in the coves and the Laguna Beach area and I don't recall personally seeing a predation event of a calf in Southern California but I do know it has occurred I think that yeah I think a number years ago and told me that this Cente though the people at the census actually witnessed that years ago I don't recall we can probably get some input some of our friends about that but but then moving up here like last season I saw more predation events than live calves I probably saw two calves coming up and down our coast and I saw what I think it was six predation events looking through my dog logs so it has a whole different world for these calves depending on which part of the coast are on it's funny because when I lived in Southern California and the killer whales we don't we don't typically see the killer whales but maybe one or two times a year down in SoCal but that has changed they saw them quite a bit this past year in 2018 but back in 2015 when I'm talking about I was actually watching a pod of killer whales during the gray whale migration and a mother and calf on the southbound sometimes these gray whales will actually have their calves early they'll have them before they get down to the lagoons in Baja and I actually watched this mom and baby passed right past a pod of killer whales and the killer whales for sure probably knew they were in the area and didn't do anything they kept swimming the opposite direction is them so I think that's pretty crazy to think that they would just pass up an opportunity like that but talking to someone they thought maybe there's just not enough yeah the baby is too small it doesn't have enough you know meat for them to eat yet so I guess that's kind of what happened with that situation but it's pretty crazy to think they would pass something up like that I'm thinking some of our are transient pods even though they're all transients I think certain pods probably prefer or specialize in certain it was the 51 yeah are they in the predation slot up here if they're not in the predation you are seen eating afterwards yeah we I personally seen the 50 ones go after sea lions and dolphins back in Southern California because the the breaching sunset what do I have the 5151 seen do a lot of takedowns the last three or four years or they've been and they've been present almost every time there's a carcass but I've actually seen them take down gray well calves most of the predation events that I've witnessed the 50 ones have been around I think they're in the area at the time probably they're not necessarily hunting them you know sometimes we'll come across a carcass not long after sunrise so some of this might be happening at night too so you take one down tonight yeah I mean they see what sound they don't need eyesight to figure out where a great way far maybe a little more energy during the daytime yeah I mean it does seem like more predictions do happen during daylight hours but there's been a few times where a carcass has been discovered pretty fresh and pretty early in the day where is happening in the dark that's amazing definitely if you do come to Monterey for during April in May for the gray whale predation our killer whale predations keep in mind that it's a pretty intense moment to watch it's not like it's not crazy Tigers blood spraying everywhere there definitely can be some blood definitely a lot of white water and if you understand what's happening it's pretty it makes it more sad I always tell people you learn things from these experiences that a textbook won't teach you I mean really do see the intelligence you see the plotting the planning the strategies especially you know once you see it more and more you're like oh especially watching from the drone yeah watching one not explained that to you Tyler well coming from the left hits it and then right when it lands another one coming straight below just one of the coolest manoeuvres I didn't even think that killer whales did I didn't notice until Slater filmed it on the drone you'll see a lot of rake marks especially on the pectoral fins of the calf and the killer whales come from underneath like they come on the ventral side of the gray whale calf and they grab the opposite PEC vent and they barrel roll it they rip the fin under total aspirate because that's how killer whales kill their food is they basically drown it they don't ever have like a fatal bite they don't get their food to bleed out because that's thick skin it has thick blubber and so they have to drown their prey and they definitely can mess up the insides oh yeah and they do yeah they did quite a bit of internal organs but yes later got a really good video one year where it's just covered in rake marks on the PEC fin and I was like what the hell are they doing and then it ripped it from underneath and spun it around I was like oh it's just what's really crazy to me is watching the mom instantly get back underneath the calf and yeah this didn't like the mom is just her main goal is to keep that cap above the water and keep it on her back and keep the killer whales away from me obviously but it's just amazing that she's trying to fight these killer whales off you know foiling her PEC fins and her fluke all over the place while trying to keep the baby up on her back watching her fluke fly while she's holding the cap her back is pretty nice they're pretty sure they're good moms but that one strategy I know this there is that one predation that happened out here it was that one that occurred right in front of cannery row that one year and we saw this one strategy where it seems like the males and the bigger killer whales were actually keeping the mom back once they eventually had the calf separated yeah oh yeah I remember tag-team so they already had the calf right yeah yeah yeah the mom was pissed yeah yeah she just liked all she was going on front of the harbor so there was like 40 boats she charged all of them in her eyes yeah she charged whatever's in front of her she was very mad for the two hours afterwards and wants to get past this scary place in the Monterey Bay these gray whales keep continue on and head back to Alaska the Bering Sea the Chukchi Sea up there where they'll continue feeding during the summer months and once it gets cold and the water starts freezing over they'll head back this way and they'll do it all over again one of the most impressive migrations of any animal but especially any mammal on earth they are making one of the longest trips and they're fasting during the trip which kind of goes back to how upset some of the moms get it's like totally justified it's a huge sacrifice to migrate while pregnant give birth and lactate and not eat yeah and be fasting lose the calf for nothing yeah I want to know that like obviously they care because there's a lot of work but they seem to like just continue on some get real sad but like think about humpbacks like or I guess any man like this after a year they pretty much go on a deep dive and they're like I'm out and then they leave the after it's you know ready to go on its own yeah you're gonna leave that whale never see it again basically I don't think we have the social component figured out too too clearly with baleen whales it does seem like it's kind of cut through I'm not saying that they don't care for you see you later I think they do care but yeah I've been in I mean I'd be pretty pissed if it's three months old I lost my kid after 15 months worth of work yeah we don't actually know it maybe they kick them out after year but we don't know if they don't if they come to Monterey Bay every year that they might see each other yeah am i running the mom exactly so they might know yeah and there's other whale like baleen whale populations like I think of the whales that come to Stellwagen bank National Marine Sanctuary in the Atlantic Ocean off the east coast of the United State they do see they know their individual whales really well and so the humpbacks they do see calves with mom years later even if mom has another calf what's happening during that interaction isn't always clear but you know I think there's a lot more going on that we just completely miss and it's kind of hard to keep tabs on individual gray whales because there's so many there's a few that really have unique markings like scar back was just sighted yesterday or today in Southern California and some that visit the same area have high site fidelity you can kind of keep tabs on them that way but I mean you're not keeping track of 25,000 gray whales as individuals anymore that's crazy that scar back isn't amazing well I guess the story behind that is in the 80s this gray whale was hit with an exploding harpoon but it must have just been lightly into the back and it kind of just blew out a little bit it's got a crazy scar on it very unique it's easy to spot once you've seen it I actually saw this well previously I think in 2015 so that's a full month for us for years now that the early 2000s cuz I grew up on the Oregon coast and scarbacks one of those resident whales that feeds in Depoe Bay and she's in the prime of her reproductive years she has a calf every other year like clockwork and she older than me yeah she's older than all of us maybe she's been around a long long time there's photos of her with the wound in the 80s but she was already an adult when she had the wound and Jim Sioux Mitch actually had a couple of us know he was one of my professors at Oregon State before he retired he suspects that the lice on scarback are part of why she stays alive because she had that wound never closed on her back it's an open wound some years it looks better than others some years it's bleeding all year long you know was the life someone pick clean and and keep it free of infection so without that good population of whale lice on her back she may have died from infections from the wound a long time ago and she's lived with it for almost 30 years have you seen scarback I don't think so I feel like it's funny because every time I scar back they see it in Dana Point like the neck you know that's a power or the next trip Eric Eric used to work just 13 miles away from where I worked I worked in Newport Beach for a long time and he worked in Dana Point which is very close to each other and so a lot of the wells I see he usually sees them on the next trip yeah or vice versa so that's pretty cool well I definitely think that that covers the majority of the gray whale migration along the California coastline what do you guys have any extra thoughts on the gray whale migration go watch it whether it's from a boat or from land it's it's really awesome go watch it they are definitely not the most acrobatic well when it comes to the central part of the coast like Eric said earlier he sees see a lot more breaching and more playful activity down south but if you don't have super high expectations you'll definitely enjoy watching them and they're so abundant especially right yeah they're leaving right now pick any place you know around the California coast I prefer points you know I've always mentioned that to people depending on if you're in Southern California central California and detail the name or location of the main point like in the south Dan the point over somewhere the dry white Pinos Point Lobos Point Sur anywhere high up you know is a great place to check these gray whales or just watch them too you know exhaling you can see tons of spouts all across the ocean right now and just you know show you how well the season is you know the last few days our trips have been seeing whales in the double digits I mean 40 whales during the am trip you know so it's definitely something you should all take advantage of if you get seasick like I said this is something you can do from a cliff and I'm sure somewhere along the California coast wherever you are there's one that's probably gonna be within your reach and another thing I think that's pretty cool about the gray whale migration the dolphins can really get them going Pacific white-sided dolphins and the bottlenose I think in my opinion really can get the gray whales and a Sukie mood i saying with the common dolphins as well but a lot of times if there's a pretty big group of gray whales two or three plus the Dolphins can get them all rolling around with each other and just really put on a great show so that's something really cool that you can get out of the gray whale migration here when we see humpbacks here during the summer months they're feeding they're not really typically pull they do they are very acrobatic don't get me wrong but they're not typically playing around with dolphins and stuff like that so that's something really cool that you can get out of the gray whale season yeah and as far as timing I mean anytime in California from like mid-november through June you have the possibility of seeing a gray whale on the boat or from shore but as far as the peak of the south bound gray whale migration which for most of the California coast is easier to see Northern California that's like the second week of January and then Central California it's usually the third and fourth week and then as you're getting down towards Southern California things are things are kind of happening all the time because there's a they're close to the crossover point they're close to Baja but definitely looking around on the coast you could you could see them for several months out of the winter time moms and calves tend to be the last to leave so you get this trickle of them through April and into early May then you'll see some gray whales and just keep in mind like I said earlier whales don't have calendars so it doesn't just cut off it just see to see them slowly slowly slowly fin off and you'll be surprised you get these weirdo gray whales pop up in the middle of summer we don't know if they're early or late I saw one at Point Lobos in August and they did not look like it yeah later sick oh and they do get lost that's another thing is sometimes you'll see them going into harbors along the coast and not just in California all the way up the coast Newport Beach is a really long Harbor compared to most of the other harbors mm-hmm Elya also has a pretty big one but we've had them go pretty far deep into the Newport Harbor which is something kind of odd yeah and they'll figure it out eventually they'll be like okay this is weird and then they'll turn around and head back out yeah and it's speaking of getting lost thinking globally there's been gray well sighted in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean Spain there used to be great whales in the Atlantic they were hunted to extinction but what the working theory is the few they've been sighted on the other side of the world lately have been Pacific grey whales that the ice created there was a thin enough ice that there was a passage across towards the North Pole they went up and over and down the Atlantic there are these explorers yeah they just got turned all the way around and one of the whales definitely did not look very good it was really really thin but one whale I mean heck it could have gone back around again what if he thought he was just a northbounder because it's now that you think about it we've been swimming north along but the coast is on his right but he's going came back over that's pretty funny well well we're pretty excited about this podcast I think we're gonna probably end it around here do you guys have any final thoughts we can't wait till next week we're happy to geek out about any whale related topics yeah we can't even talk about any there's always cool stuff happening here we can talk about latest well watching news too and since this is our first podcast we can actually ask you guys what are some topics you would like us to talk about it doesn't just have to be about the California coast by any means we like to talk about whales everywhere and so if you guys have any questions or comments or just things or topics that we can talk about please let us know I don't know where this is gonna be posted as it right now so wherever it is they'll probably like a comment section or something so yeah we look forward for you guys to listen to this and we look forward to creating for you thanks for listening thanks everyone have a great day or night wherever you are and just be awesome

welcome back everybody to the second episode of the Whale nerds podcast my name is Slater I'm here with Eric and Katelyn hi everyone welcome back we just wanted to first say thank you to all of you people for all the amazing feedback and just for downloading and listening to our podcast we're super excited about it and just to hear all of that oh yeah wow the feedback from numerous people thanks for all of it it seems like most of it's been positive have you guys heard anything negative yet yeah they said you sounded funny sorry for sounding funny we appreciate the topic suggestions too I mean we can rant forever about whales but we want to know what you want to hear about you speaking of feedback Eric and Caitlin just got back from a little marine mammal workshop down in Southern California do you guys have anything you want to say about that do you learn anything they left me they left me by the way I was supposed to go and my phone I guess didn't I don't know just didn't go through and when they tried calling we learned a lot we learned a lot but the one thing that you missed out is seems like everything was pretty depressing this year but informative [Music] it was exciting but just a little sad I think one thing that marine scientists are not necessarily the best at is thinking about the human element and taking care of emotions of people involved in some of this work and so it was it was kind of hard to hear about endangered species and what are what are our plans for how to conserve populations that are really just on the brink if not already too late and then we followed that discussion with the impacts of plastic in the ocean which has also been very hot in the news and was it's also a pretty sad story so it's more than just straws and cups it's more than just drawers and cups one of the big things that a lot of a lot of people already know this but it was just you know emphasized again this time was clothing simply washing your clothes does put microplastics into the ocean so that was kind of concerning but there are a few things that we talked about you know what the panel over there that are being done to even prevent that so it's kind of hard you could you can try but there's little things that you probably don't even know that are still kind of putting plastics into the ocean yeah and some feedback actually we were talking like at lunch outside of the session with one of the panelists on the plastic panel and she and I were kind of geeking out about plastic things that's actually what I did my undergrad thesis on at Oregon State was people's perception of marine debris and Monterey County actually did a really good job this past year of putting out all the information about what they can and cannot process what can be recycled what can't what can hand be handled in their compost digester and so we're actually pretty lucky that our local area like the dump says what they can and cannot take and they'll even tell you what happens to it they just did a recycle workshop on Saturday that we were gone for so that's kind of nice some some places or disposal places are trying to think of yeah even when you go to Whole Foods now they have like up at the front where you can like cook your food and stuff they have three bins and now there's a picture on each one of like that kind of helps you know what you can put into each trash cans and there's three of them now there so that's pretty cool sorry to talk trash about you Californians but we've been ahead of the game in Oregon on this for a long time I think growing up in the Portland metro area so so make sure you know there's so many trees it covers your mess the public service for a long time and so I'm just finally people are getting caught up here because it is a big problem and we have to start doing something different so is there anything else you guys learned at that uh workshop the second day we did a lot of well we listened to a lot of people talk about the state of acoustic impacts on whales which has been coming up more and more in the field they're getting better and better information about that but it was kind of a hot political topic because there's been a lot of pressure from the Trump administration to take up seismic exploration again in a lot of places along the u.s. coast that it has happened and that's a little scary for our whales and dolphins because they rely so heavily on the ocean sounds and that would be very disruptive and Caitlin also sent me a text message while she was down at that marine mammal workshop about communicating science on like social platforms or podcasts or maybe even vlogs on YouTube and stuff like that what was that about yes so we did our final session was a workshop on science communication and it sounds like Susan had done this before in previous years that Eric had been there but this is the first time I'd heard it from her and I think it was good for everybody in the room to hear someone who's not a scientist talked about how to communicate science cuz it's good to get a different perspective and some of it's not new information for people like Eric and I because that's what we do on the whale watch boat is we communicate science to the general public but she did a good job of explaining like I think some of my favorite takeaways from the whole thing was you can't communicate doom and gloom to people it doesn't work you just go through like this yeah disaster fatigue and people just disengage but also we're in the conference people were like well we can't just say that we've saved the whales anymore because some whales are saved and some whales aren't and we have to start to get specific and Susan was like no the save the whales thing people are bought in on it roll with it take the win go for it and I was like yes you're right thank you like I'm glad somebody's paying attention to what the general public is receptive of because I think we kind of lose sight of that when we're in the thick of the science part and so it's it's good to have another person outside the field go what do you want them to do you need to really seriously think about what do you want them to do and that's the cool part about doing this podcast you know where this is science communication and we're trying to make it more of a fun and approachable way of doing it so that people feel like they're they're getting good information and it's not like reading a textbook and it's something that's engaging yeah and that's something I love with photography and shooting videos of these animals is showing them in such a beautiful light I feel I can bring people and even closer to these animals and then you can kind of slowly show them what else is going on in their lives the good and the bad so you don't maybe you can hook these people in with inspiring and motivational stories and then slowly let them know about the things that aren't going so well in the ocean and they can continue to inspire other people as well so despite all the doom and gloom I was in this like optimism freefall Friday night we got to breakfast Saturday morning evict Eric I was like even though yesterday was so depressing I actually feel really optimistic one why was so depressing is because like the vaquita is in this yeah you know all these small odana see populations around the world that are just like finless porpoise let's port back sorry finless porpoise over in China the humpback dolphin I was just gonna say I want to see how I'm back yeah west coast of Africa or you know not looking too hot and there's a lot of area for them to cover with that one you know it's not like the vaquita where it's only the northern part of the Gulf of California you know so yeah there's a lot of area that needs to be covered and then those all of the Amazon River Dolphin subspecies and species are also in trouble the freshwater dolphins it's not to say but you know when you have something that giant black and white it looks like a panda everyone gives them attention but our poor vaquita various porpoises and the Dolphins you know or just kind of overlooked you know there's a few people who are paying attention to him but or don't even know about or don't even know about me I mean I didn't even I didn't know one of the ones you just mentioned yeah the finless porpoise yeah I mean I might have heard of it but not I mean never heard people talk about it dolphins I know that there were some dolphins in that book that went extinct because they dammed off the rice yeah yeah a woman and anthe and they Amazon - they've lost populations of dolphins from diverting water from the river damming it or not paying attention that they were in there as levels got low it's actually super amazing that we are able to see the animals that we have here in this Bay because after reading that book the death and life of Monterey Bay I think we pretty much hunted everything - it wasn't just wails it was whales abalone the sea otters the kelp and then and then it went to the kelp and then now and then there was like pretty much nothing and then they kicked all the fishermen out and oh and then the sardines yep and then they kicked all the fishermen out pretty much for the most part and its really come back to this new stablished status quo and it's still very fragile in Monterey Bay for sure but what I would say about one of the big reasons why I love marine science is the marine scientists are some of the most innovative and creative people I know because they work in an environment that they cannot be in physically most of the time so they have to think of how to use all their context clues from the ocean to answer the questions they're trying to answer like we listen a lot of information we get about these really rare whale species is from acoustics because you just can't sit on a boat all day every day and hope to see them and so thinking outside the box all the time is one of the reasons why I love marine biology and I really do think that we are gonna be able to solve some of these problems what I've been seeing lately is the shift of like I think we're gonna have to start to talk to social scientists to really have a conservation messaging plan that works well I think we're gonna have to reach across party lines and start working with other adjacent fields to get answers and solutions to these problems and I think that's very big of marine scientists to try and try and branch out and reach out and think you know realize that they're not going to be able to solve this on their own and everybody looks like they're just kind of like gnawing on it chewing on it trying to digest it and pretty soon something's gonna shake loose something's gonna break through and we're gonna get some really revolutionary stuff going on as far as protecting you know whales and dolphins and porpoises yeah and I definitely think the time is now with all the technology and all the things we have going for us out on the ocean in the communication with through other like whale watch companies and research boats in the area we're really like working together yeah we're trying to work together and switching topics to another marine mammal that our buddy Eric when saw last week yeah I think it's just last week what did you do tell me what you did last week I actually went over the Florida again I went up to the Gulf side just north of Tampa to area known as homeless fascist Springs and also the Crystal River area it's area that this time of year when it gets nice and cool you get a good amount of manatees coming into the area that's awesome that's something I really wish I would have went over there and done with you it's the pictures you got were unbelievable yeah I wasn't bad that's a pretty amazing experience you know it's one of those situations I mean I tell you I get this a lot you always get I'll show people some pictures of me in the water with them they're like oh my god why are you so close what are you doing it's just kind of like that baha experience you know don't say anything till you really check out the situation or experience it yourself you get into the water there I'm guessing they're curious yes I've had them everybody thinks that animals aren't they're not curious yeah just as curious is us yeah I got video of a manatee literally like following me for a good amount of time to the point where the boat crew was yelling at me you know they get back on the boat we got to pick up some other people they're curious they will get right in your head on all boats yeah I've been duped by numerous manatees there there are six people on the boat one day each each individual person had you know six manatees literally following them around in fact I already showed a lot of you know my co-workers the videos of this manatee you can even why my hands and feet I'm just floating there and this thing's just floatin down the river with me rolling on its back you know it's showing me it's its belly and stuff like that but yeah when it gets nice and cool there these animals will go up to these springs where to water it comes out of the ground about 7 82 degrees so it's kind of like a natural little jacuzzis for these animals you post it on Facebook all the different tail flukes mm-hmm so go on flukes yeah yeah so you posted all those is that a way they can ID him but yeah big bang but not as extravagant yeah they can do that and there's also kind of like you know our grazing humpback so you get you know a lot of little scars and stuff all over the body yeah and unfortunately just like our you know their citation counterparts they have to deal with all over there it's not really ship strike but you know boat strikes these rivers unfortunately are frequented by many many many many many you know small boats and you know it's hard to patrol that area there are numerous signs and warnings especially this time of year you know telling people to slow down and unfortunately a lot of these animals do get struck so they you know are unfortunately in decline because of that also you know we do know the Gulf side of Florida did experience that red tide issue so there's a lot of factors that are affecting our manatee friends also although it sounds like a couple years ago you've been - yeah but unfortunately I do have nearly as good of an experiences Erin each other second night I got horrible food poisoning and miss one of the days I did get in the water with one it was really brackish water the visibility was not very good and it was that's what I was expecting when you go there I wasn't expecting like you had some like visibility when it's really really cool and the manatees are way up in the springs that's when it's the best we were there very early and things had not cooled off yet so they were kind of in the estuary and so it wasn't as good of an encounter yes it depends on you know certain conditions like obviously if you have the heavy rains you know the night before or 4:00 you know previous days it does muck up the water one thing I've learned you know just going up and down the Gulf Coast side is the most popular area is to do this experience is Crystal River and then the Homosassa Springs area Crystal River just like the name says the water is crystal clear but there's a lot a lot a lot a lot of people there also Homosassa the water is my experiences have has been you know not as clear but I it's there's not that many people there you literally have you know the animals all to yourself so we're in for a more personable experience or more mellow atmosphere Homosassa Springs is that the way to go I'm glad you touched on that because I would have not known which one to go to the propeller strike issues so sometimes like we're saying the water is not very clear and then manatees are not very distinguishable at the surface I mean they have a pretty flexible set of face muscles and so they can really just get their tuned airs up out of the water and just take a breath and set their nose you guys you just saw her and then the rest of their body blends in pretty well with the surface of the water or like it's pretty camouflaged if it's murky and their back doesn't usually break the surface too much so it is easy for boaters if they don't have a trained eye to totally miss a manatee and that's why they say that you really should go slow just so you have a better chance of spotting one in case you're like really really close yeah it's kind of like especially this time of year with our gray whales yo I mean 50 foot gray whales you experience whale watchers no can literally disappear from you and these manatees aren't exactly a tiny creature you know they can get close to ten feet long and you'll be surprised when they pop up to breathe it literally is just those two nostrils breaking the surface of the water so you know a boater is cautious they can be concealed miss that you know depending on the conditions and stuff like that just I was out there and the windy windy or yeah just those a little wind waves and ripples will harm your visibility and luckily there's some you know these animals aren't in transit there are a lot of the spring areas that they gather that are actually roped off and cordoned off and sometimes it's seasonal that give these animals a fighting chance but yeah Florida's doing what they're can't to help out these animals and when I was crystal river it sounded like the gulfside population is actually on seeing an increase but some of the other subpopulations especially down towards the Caribbean are still struggling is that what they told you when you I'm not really sure about the the current status of the animals but I know I believe last year I think it was the numbers were pretty pretty sad as far as the loss of animals but speaking of speaking of manatees and in the East Coast well you know what that bru this well did you guys hear about that though washed up over in Florida yeah that actually came up with the workshop too so in the Gulf of Mexico there's a really small population of British whales and you think that's the ones that are coming up here that we see like it or not here I'm sorry about like Newport Beach because we saw him in the summer just kidding so the the reason it came up at the workshop is because they're talking about using Florida as an example of like a very industrialized ocean well actually the other side Florida is not very industrialized as far as oil platforms but like Texas Louisiana and Mississippi are and so the Brutus whales kind of exist more towards the Florida side they think because there's not nearly as much acoustic disturbance with all those air guns going off for seismic exploration but yeah they said there that population is probably only about 30 animals and I forgot the exact area but yeah it's way off the coast of Florida I remember the acronym that put on the map that they they got it was DC so you folks from the Gulf Coast the East Coast might know what I'm talking about yeah whatever is way off the Florida coast enough I am a protected species observer for the seismic industry I took a certification a couple years ago and Burgess whales are one of those species where you are allowed if you are on an airgun boat as an observer you're looking for endangered species in the vicinity of the air guns behind the vessel and you are allowed to cease all you're allowed to tell the captain shut everything off if you see a Brutus whale because it is a species of real special concern so seeing one dead on over there just only over there and only on seismic boats where they have allocated that observer said do you know anything about our bird I suppose no this side of Mexico yeah yeah for yeah on the before Kazik means later yeah over from Southern California doesn't brutha swells that actually will frequent the Southern California area so when things warm up yeah you can probably definitely get a chance to see those and know one of our last El Ninos yeah it was pretty good off of the coast of whoa pretty much all these guys in california boats yeah got to see him I personally saw him off of off of the Long Beach boats that dunno Newport and the Dana Point boats got to enjoy them too and I think I'm pretty sure everybody's in San Diego too definitely oh I'm sure the chance to see them too yeah I remember the first time I saw the breeders well and actually flew the drone down in Newport and they're fast they're fast whales yeah a smaller fin well you know yeah basically a smaller fin whale and I remember when we first started seeing them there is always that little debate when we had pictures especially you know without drone footage when you just looked on the sides you look at that dorsal fin you're like you know that dorsal fin looks kind of funny but I'm not sure what it is but then we we all realize when we found more educated about the brute as well as we you need those those drone shots helped out a lot because you can see those ridges on you know above the animal's head that will give you positive identification whereas your fin has was the single order to yeah I think it's a single Ridge and then your beer brew this is gonna have three distinct ridges so that was just a fin whale has right yeah but I mean again like same thing with the British whale trying to get it to have its head above water enough to see the ridge is the same thing with the fin whale it's hard to get that view for them you know in Southern California where you have better visibility sometimes you can see it yeah you can do well yeah after seeing them and now more often down there or in the past you could tell you kind of tell ya it was alright well certain captains won't usually get you know get you on the other side of the whales so sometimes it's just up to a good photographer or a drone you know I know sometimes when you're few of us have been on research boats yeah you will have a captain who notes it's his job to go left side right side on the whale yeah those British situations we couldn't get to that on the way I like to confirm the white job you're really just keeping the Sun out of people's faces alright so we thought about concluding the episode with some questions from you guys we did get a few questions on my Instagram personally and then a couple on the well nerds Instagram and if you're not following the Instagram make sure you follow us at the well nerds on Instagram but one of the question was asking about rare sightings in the eastern Pacific and it got me thinking about the right whales that used to be in Monterey but and be in that book that I just read they talked about how they've pretty much killed every single one of them and they have I mean I haven't seen it right well I've never seen one yeah or not North Pacific right whales especially here in the eastern Pacific it's it's always been kind of a gloomy picture there are estimates that it's probably thirty animals and not much is known about them as I always say you know good research with Wales hasn't started you know probably for what probably only start about 50 40 years ago people used to look at the right whale and instead of going oh cool right well it was like man that's like you know 100 barrels of oil thousand dollars yeah exactly took from a thousand dollars always worth yeah well back then it was probably I mean I equals like probably 10 - those whales seeing them is obviously a privilege and you're probably going to be the you are the luckiest person in the world the last sightings that were just a few years ago there was one off the Channel Islands one off of La Jolla and then one literally in the Sur pretty much in the surf of the la jolla area the media actually got a video of it and they posted they posted it you know and it's funny it's it's literally right in front of the you know a prestigious you know a Marine Lab right off of scripts and area and it took someone people Wow look at this video going that doesn't look like a gray whale and then finally people chatting to like oh you're right that's actually a right whale so those are the last confirmed sighting of these animals aren't the exact date but it was just what last year or two years ago yeah so this whale is you know quite a rarity the migration pattern well they're kind of figuring it out just from sightings you know obviously Gulf of Alaska and then down towards Baja even sightings in the I mean they're doing pretty far offshore it seems like there was a Alaska sorry I mean ya know almost Hawaii so you know what we thought we knew is kind of being expanded you know so in a few animals we don't know yet in that book when they talked about how they pretty much hunted all of them do you think that they meant up and down the entire coast like they made it kind of sounded like they hunted them out of the Monterey Bay what do you think that they this was they they hunted all the way down to Mexico all the way to the gray whales oh yeah so yeah do you think they hunted the right whales all the way up and down the class oh yeah it wasn't like majority here it was all spread out yeah picture of one of the slides from the workshop because they talked about the North Pacific right whale and it says 20 they estimate 21,000 to 30,000 right whales were killed in the decade of the 1840s alone ten years thirty thousand potentially thirty thousand right whales and then the other thing that they talked about which I Eric and I knew about this already but I don't know if you know about this later the USSR illegally hunted whales for years without telling anyone they lied on they like had this code to to have the log books look like they weren't hunting whales and right whales suffered heavily because of it I think that's it is that why the log books are kind of messed up right they didn't know exact numbers that were taken yeah they weren't all there all right whales blue whales fin whales humpback whales yeah we're all taken dragon blue whale or no I mean they're they're around eighty eighty to a hundred feet but that's just insane yeah and all of them I mean they were just constantly every single day hunting whales yeah we're so lucky to be able to see them now where we're literally in an area you know here in Monterey we are an area that historically was you know whaling stations you know to have important it's actually named after Whaler yeah Moss Landing you know we even have some old timers on the old timers old timers on the wharf who actually remember the whaling stations and some of them have even taken stuff there that's a that's gonna be another podcast but I've heard some pretty interesting stories from our old-timers and their interactions with the whaling stations here I think it was in the millions it was a million yeah incredible that's crazy yeah just look at it piece by piece yeah blue whales a couple hundred thousand taken you know so yeah it's pretty grim let's end on it maybe a more positive note working down in Southern California we would maybe see like one two five humpback sightings in an entire year as of like what 2000 2014 and now we've been having humpbacks almost throughout the entire year not in big numbers but they've been showing up down there at least a few a few in a month so one of the interesting like what is becoming a rare sighting and it's kind of a mystery mysterious thing is pilot whales have you guys seen pilot whales yeah I haven't seen pilot whales have it since I was a little kid that's a thing but yeah I'm older than you guys I remember yeah certain California seeing them off of Catalina Island but yeah that's something that a lot of I've seen them on a survey ship west of Point Conception a couple hundred miles and then I know someone else that saw them west of the farallon's on that same survey they travel yeah I know a majority of the more recent sightings it seems like they're most of them they're not by whale watching boats have been out on the backside of you know the Channel Islands I know yeah behind San Clemente up behind the San Clemente Island now some of my fishing buddies have run into him out there so yeah like a lot of the recent sightings not by whale watching boats have been been way out there but yeah I mean Caitlin can probably talk about what the basic theory is about why our pilot whales have disappeared I know there's a big talk about them yes kind of sounds like a combination of factors but maybe maybe a shift in habitats is one of the more recent things but they were extracted for the captive industry they were popular in aquariums and zoos and things but then also there was a lot of squid fishing and competition and acoustic disturbance more towards them the late 70s and so that may have caused this disruption where the pilot whales were just like we got to leave the area there's too much going on here we don't like it anymore and then the mid-80s El Nino the 80 to 83 El Nino really disrupted the squid fishery and like the squid populations took a big hit so they may have just vacated the area because there's no food and they'd already been disturbed a lot by the fishing boats and they follow the food around like toothed whales there pretty much and we had we did have gill nets around decades ago off our coastline yeah and they were pretty you know hit by being a bycatch item and I think still today a lot of in fact if we have any NOAA observers listening going out in commercial boats yeah they were they're still being recorded as bycatch every now and then way offshore they banned they banned gill nets on California yeah yep and actually Monterey Bay was and Monterey Bay was one of the big places where the like public I was put on gill nets a couple people from Moss Landing marine labs in the mid-80s our graduate students actually lined up a bunch of Harvard porpoises with gill net rings around their head the carcasses on the beach and like called the news and was like look at this problem we are doing all these little animals for with gill nets and they stopped using gill nets and one of the success stories which is actually gives some hope for the vaquita to is harbour porpoise started to rien habit San Francisco Bay in the last ten to fifteen years and since the gill net ban has been in place they think that well yeah the san francisco harbour porpoise that's it that's a different story what many people actually let them to actually disappear from the San Francisco Bay is actually during the world wars Lobby they'll notice but there was actually a huge net actually set across the mouth of the San Francisco Bay to keep out Eric told me to keep out submarines and the since then the harbour porpoise actually left and it was I think it's a little bit been a little bit over a decade that they have finally showed back up in good numbers in fact if you guys ever go to San Francisco and you want a good look at a harbour porpoise F tide when the tide is moving you can take a walk along the Golden Gate Bridge look down and your chances of seeing these harbour porpoise actually yeah I've actually done it I've actually done a few times I've stood over the Golden Gate Bridge and that you know headed over towards number inside and just look down was pretty lucky to see yeah good aerial view of them but you know they're obviously not a rare sighting anymore in the San Francisco Bay Area merging San Francisco Bay Area citing those becoming more regulars humpback whales - yeah there was actually 60 that they have actually identified you know through a photo ID that been hanging out in the San Francisco Bay Area and a lot of them are the whales that we are actually familiar than here in the Monterey Bay yeah there are whales just smoothing services going in then coming back somewhat I was just gonna say yeah someone hasn't breaching humpback someone also has a photo shop oh that's definitely shot I want to forgot about beaked whales we've been really lucky with b12 yeah I've been really lucky I missed all of them yes later where have you been yeah 2018 was a good year for b12 and the Monterey Bay yeah we got what we had bears and cougars yeah I'm not missing it I mean you guys got did you did you both get to see the nursery promise from whales in SoCal I've seen sperm yes but yeah I don't even know what I was doing with the camera then stop now helmet and want a new shot at photographing them the Monterey is great yeah deepwater beaked whales yeah I got a good look at those well good really really really unbelievable good looks at the Bears they even had some some calves with them and then kouhei's oh my god but what I really wanted to see him I told someone about them and they're like they're no big deal wait wait what's one do you think is like a higher chance of seeing it's not safety when you look at the sighting information historically for Monterey Bay they see both quite often especially the sea bird trips when they go offshore they see one or the other was it them pretty often was it the birds that you said they had recordings of like two hours over to coulier's can yet confirmed yeah it's been 2 hours and 17 minutes but when they it was really weird our sightings the sightings we try to put like two to three other boats on them you expect the long diving well that come up and stay up for a while like sperm whales and the Barrett stayed up forever these things literally show their dorsal fins like two or three times and disappeared and we try to put them other boats try they came back you know behind us and they're like that's all we saw you know we saw those dorsal fin sort of distance down with it was like so did we so they're not much so yeah my friend who told me that no big deal unfortunately she was right it was so a good experience obviously I have a theory on that maybe you found them right when they found some food so they were like taking a quick breather and they were going down that's my that's my theory is they're pretty brief at the surface the Baird's one time I was on a long-range trip and we actually waited for the Barrett's to come back up and they came back up in the same spot after about 45 to 50 minutes and you if you were really paying attention and timing them you could see them do their decompression dives like at one point they all disappeared for about four minutes and then they all were back up again for another seven or eight minutes and so it was like they had taken a dive to decompress then they came back up and they were doing shallower and shallower dives as they just did this big circle around the boat so yeah but my cuvees experience is like three breasts they're gone yeah it's pretty pretty odd and it's funny is we were actually heading to some Orca and then our cut our captain made a sudden turn and you know nothing makes you you know turn away from from Orca so we knew it was a big deal except for when J days driving we didn't see a puffin one time and he wouldn't turn to look at it I wanted to see the puppet when we found that nazca boobie same thing remember yeah that thing that thing came so close our boat yeah why is it we ride over a safari circle that's a whole nother level of rare sighting situations as we also are looking at rare birds when we're out there on the water so what we're saying is if you guys want the rare sightings you need to try to go whale watching as much as Jessel go yeah yeah as long as the weather's good it's a good time to go whale watching yeah and as I always say you know whales bird dolphins they don't read textbooks you know just because it's not the right time of year for something just get out there you just never know what might pop up what might happen you know just because it's not something that in season or your favorite animals not gonna be out there yeah just get out in the water as much as you can yeah well I think that was a really long conclusion I tell you what we're gonna is gonna be like six hours one day we're just gonna keep talking yeah but we just want to for sure say thank you to all of you who made it this far on the podcast and listened to our last one if you guys have any questions comments or anything of that nature please send us a DM on the well nerds podcast on the hour the well nerds Instagram and yeah we'd love to hear feedback and thanks for listening alright bye everyone go whale watching

hello everyone and welcome back to the wail nerds podcast this is episode three my name is Slater and I'm here with Eric and Caitlin if you're wondering why we are doing episode three again we had a little bit of a mishap with the audio file there was a few skips in that podcast I don't even know if you guys noticed it but there was a missing intro and a couple other things so what we're gonna do is we're gonna change the subject and we'll come back to that one on a later date but today we thought we would talk about what do you think in [Music] probably telling the people the difference between our toothed whales and our baleen whales otherwise known as so bear with us through as we're learning this whole podcasting thing thanks for sticking with us even though we're redoing this is episode 3.1 there you go three point one three squared so let's see I start with the Dolphins there are two Thwaites how many blow holes they have Eric one blow hole a single bull at the top of their head there's two types of odontocetes purposes and the main difference is their teeth so dolphins have conical teeth so they look like little sharp fangs porpoises have flat teeth they also also call them spade-shaped teeth what I like to compare it to is your bottom teeth in your jaw they're flat kind of like those ones in the front all around their mouth and all toothed whales have one single blowhole yeah on the outside they do have to blow holes on the inside on their skull alright that's science it's cool cuz that's how they make sound so the other blowholes part of their sound production inside their head and what did they say that basically there was two blow holes at one point in time and it slowly removed itself and kind of came went towards the front of the Mayland it's like basically like your sinuses so like we also have these paths where like like mucus and things move around in our face and so they have something similar but they're able to push air around inside their forehead and that's how they channel sound out through the melon which focuses the sound so it's in a specific direction so is that close they didn't need one so it went towards that way towards echolocation one becomes more like a closed loop to move air around in the head now alright and there's lots and lots of different types of dolphins yeah as small as the vaquita or the harbour porpoise and then as big as the sperm whale or they don't work out exactly sir miles are pretty interesting because they are technically you know Donna sea even though a lot of people think that they fall into the whale category they are a toothed whale they have one blowhole and it's way at the front of their huge head and then there's tons of arguments on whether the killer whale as a dolphin or a whale people that from people that don't know they're both exactly so happens when you let the Whalers name things without like doing all the signs first yeah and then you got your baleen whales which all have to blow holes on top of their head and the baleen plates which is like a little mustache hanging down from the roof of their mouth that's what mrs. C roughly translates to is the mustache in the mouth that's kind of where what it means hey guys you know what you forgot that the other differences between dolphins and porpoises we can talk about that for a while as well because I'm sure people wondering is that the only difference with the balls and the teeth their dorsal fins are also more of like a triangular shape right exactly the porpoises and then there's the finless porpoise yeah so use a complicated yeah it's kind of fun once you learn it but it's pretty simple I mean yeah the dorsal fin is a major difference in porpoise it's usually very triangular short and squat on the dolphin that's usually gonna be more tall and a foul Kate which is kind of more swept back yeah they both have one one blowhole we just talked about the teeth dolphin use yep conical porpoise have like a more of a flat spade shape also one difference is it's not a physical difference but it seems like aged lifespan yep is a difference yeah like 20 years old is pretty old for most porpoise but most often species live 30 plus years and some species live 70 80 90 maybe a hundred years so the porpoise like their lifespan generally shorter there's a lot of argument to about whether they're evidence of convergent evolution or not so did they come from the same ancestor on land or did they come from two different ancestors on land and then they developed a similar body style for a long time we thought it was convergent evolution to separate land ancestors but now it sounds like the phylogeny or going back the other way they came from the same animal type on land and then differentiated in the sea so do you think what do you think like the closest from between like dolphin and then a porpoise you think the closest like relative they would have on land II mean well like in the water like if where they split I think I could just say Pacific white-sided dolphin look pretty close to us well that brings up against you know the one difference we just still left out it's in general they're thinking that porpoises usually have a more of a blunt rostrum yeah but if you really look at the difference between a Pacific white-sided dolphin or a ball nose you can you know see it's pretty obvious right there but you know we still classify a Pacific white-sided dolphin as a dolphin and then your Rizzo's dolphins same thing you know they have a really blunt face and so there's a few people out there thinking that some of our animals that specialize in probably eating cephalopods have developed more of a flatter type of rostrum like porpoise probably because makes a little bit easier to and to go after so cephalopods squid octopus for example you know if yeah if you go along you're not promote exactly you got tentacles and then you have beat whales yeah they mostly only need cephalopods in the deep sea and they have yeah but they got they got two teeth sticking out of the front of their face yeah but generally the ones that also eat squid as a specialty don't have very many T so you're kind of right with that with the beaked whales they're kind of ruthless and toothless Rizzo's dolphins don't have very many teeth either but the shape of the teeth is cone-shaped even in beaked whales as well who also fall into the odontocetes category and beaked whales are kind of like porpoises and dolphins they also have a unique set of structures mostly around the face where they have it's just it's kind of hard to describe it other than it looks like a beak like a bottlenose dolphin but with even more of an intense shape of a melon like more bulbous head but still that thick stout beak yeah they look a lot different there's a pretty different yeah they're big and so they you know you see how whalers call them whales but they're whales with a face like a bottlenose dolphin kind of it's like anything over 25 a 23 they start calling them whales yeah whale in their name yeah so melon-headed whales not in their scientific name no just in their just in their comedy yeah yes so yeah it's kind of interesting we're still trying to hash it all out the hard part about trying to find fossils for a lot of these animals as they may be buried in the deep sea or you know not complete skeletons and so trying to figure out how they're all related is still an up-and-coming part of the science but if they're buried in the sea what are those what are the things they eat the bones on the bottom or the other ones yeah type of worm to vacuole eat the the bones of um I forgot exactly I think some guys actually all right scripts describe them yeah don't remember much about them but yeah I remember checking out well Falls and you know they thought once the well was down to bones it was pretty much done but no there is a type of warm out there that that will for decades feed on those bones yeah actually I heard a fun fact at the Exploratorium they do like a Thursday night science after-dark thing up in San Francisco and they think now that whale Falls they put it really interestingly like they think gray whales live 50 to 75 years and they also think that their skeleton supports a whale fall deep sea ecosystem for 50 to 75 years so they like double their lifespan with their contribution to the nutrient cycling of the deep sea which was pretty cool Wow so they're basically their body feeds things for about 70 years after yeah a pretty interesting subject what's a bummer was you know the Aquarium of the Pacific used to have a exhibit just dedicated to whale Falls but unfortunately I think it actually got taken out because the remodeling but it was only a few exhibits that actually you know talked strictly about that because it's such an important little little mini ecosystem on the bottom of our sea floors speaking of fossils and bones and stuff there's a place in Friday Harbor and the San Juan Islands and the whale museum and they have skeletons of orcas gray whales I think they have a minke whale they have common dolphin they have lots of skeleton structures there and they're really cool I highly recommend going to that that area and checking all that stuff out I really like looking at like odana see skulls so any toothed whale skull because if you look at it straight on from like your opposite of it it's you almost think it's crooked because it's asymmetrical and that's how they get directionality with their hearing in their communicating and the killer whales pectoral fins are huge yeah like it was a male it's a male that's in there I'm pretty sure was a it was a transient so it was a huge way looks like big hands [Laughter] so mysticetes are we are we good with the dolphin and porpoise yeah so back to the missus seats wait mustache since we're talking about mr. seeds and it's gray well season tell them how they're the only whale that feeds into mud yeah so there's there's three main methods of missus eat feeding there's the lunge feeders there's the skim feeders or Ram feeders and the the ones that dig in the sand and gray whales are the only ones left in their category that dig in the sand is their main way of finding food so it's kind of interesting their baleen is pretty short and coarse and they they go down on their side most of them are right-handed so they go down on their right side in the sand and they open their mouths once they're down there to create like negative pressure to create suction and they suck in the sand the amphipods in the sand which they want and the water and then out the other side of their mouth is the sand is getting blown out the other side basically as they're chomping and wiggling in the bottom and they make these little pits it's actually cool if you kind of see it from a click razinin tried to leave like Martin because yeah they leave like yeah there's like all these little yeah these little holes in the sand you can actually according to a talk by Cascadia they're actually you can actually see some of those pits created by them by a certain population that I shouldn't say population yet a certain few gray whales that actually go to the northern Puget Sound yeah and actually eat ghost shrimp and Google Maps if you go in there you can actually see those topic but I love looking up those coordinates and there's like you know the elephant CEO of Africa I mean there are so much stuff to look at about but it's really cool so when you watch a gray whale feeding like that sometimes I've seen it from shore in Oregon cuz they feed off the Oregon coast in the summertime it's like this muddy mess at the surface so you see this whale kind of wiggling around and then this muddy mess and then what happens when they write themselves is they're sifting all that sand out but the baleen is catching all the amphipods inside and then they swallow it whole and so that's kind of a unique way to use the baleen is because it has to be able to set up to sift through sand and water not just water so that's a little bit different challenge than the rest of the mysticetes and just a little ways back you said that the gray whales are mainly right-sided and one of the ways this is one of my favorite facts actually just put this on my Instagram about a week ago and one of the ways they know that gray whales are either right-sided or left-sided is by the way they feed gray whales will actually have their barnacles or whale lice and stuff scraped off the side of the face that they feed on and that's how they know that they're right-sided or left-sided exactly there are a few that are left-sided is it similar proportion many humans yeah yeah similar to the proportion of humans that are left-handed I'm right-handed I'm right-handed you know we're statistically insignificant right now we follow the majority so the rest of the Missis eats the RAM feeders our right whales and bowhead whales so they skim at the top they constantly swim with their mouths open or at least I never seen I've never seen any footage of them feeding I don't think there's not a lot out there but there is some and it's pretty trippy to watch because they have like this pretty big gap in the front of their mouth whereas other baleen whales the baleen comes almost all the way up right to the end but there's a pretty big gap and then they have this huge tongue and it just like creates this big funnel to siphon the water through the mouth and then it comes out the side of the plates and that's why they have those really weird-looking jaws that are big bow shaped and the really tall baleen cuz their filters as those television goes right out the side like how when a fish has its mouth open and then things go across the gills yeah kind of like that as far as like the flow of the water but quite a different those are two whales I really want to see me - yeah I definitely see the head right well yeah you the southern right whales in Chile I had a friend that was just down there doing some sort of research yeah they're there their population is recovering a lot better than the northern counterparts the Pacific and the Atlantic ones and you can see them in New Zealand or Australia which one is it I think Australia Western Australia they see them they show up in New Zealand oh yeah everywhere but here catching a gray whale episode 3.2 yeah I think we talked about that where the first episode how rare they are yeah yeah it's pretty interesting a lot of the whale watch boats in Monterey actually the baleen they have is from a bowhead or a right whale and most of the pieces that I've ever worked with on deck or taller than me just one plate is taller the media I mean I'm five foot catamaran think they get or close to 13 18 feet something they can be I know it's over ten feet yeah yeah well the front ones are a lot shorter than the ones towards the back as that they match like the Boeing did Jojo yeah exactly but the head of these whales I mean if you look at the old photos from the whaling days of people standing next to bow heads and right whales I mean that's it just their head is like twice this really tall ball Nicklin has one next to the bowhead whale I believe yeah and Brian scary has one next to the right well yeah I mean you could say I could what I tell people's when I hold the Bailey and I'm like I could stand up inside this whale's mouth with it closed and then the roar Qualls is the last the lunge feeders in the last type which are the most common especially here in California that's what we see most often humpback whales minke whales fin whales blue whales say well as breeders whales they all fall into that so they all have those accordion-style muscles those pleats on the throat that go from their chin to their belly button they open a huge mouthful take it in and then they push it back out and strain it out after they've taken a big gulp those police are really cool yeah they use them to basically slows them down yeah yeah they're all the water and then is it what did the Goldberg in last year those nerves are very stretchy yeah they said it was like the craziest material like stretching itself yeah yeah yeah it's like nothing else no other animal on earth has something that stretchy that's a nerve in that book spying on whales I just started listening to it there are some science me actually the Goldberg in lab at Hopkins is just down the street from where we are here they do a lot of the biomechanics so they calculate what it takes for a whale to do those kind of behaviors and they said that any whale that's more than 60 feet long doubles its body volume when it takes in all that water to fill its throat please so really really big humpbacks and then pretty much anything bigger than a humpback is doubling its body volume in water just by opening that mouth yeah there's a lot of amazing new things they've been figuring out that lab I dunno I think they upped the the volume of a blue whale's mouth I remember hearing one of their grad students are they're saying that they just measured it about what twenty-one thousand gallons or so we started to say about 17 or so but I was like wow keep on hearing that figure figure go up so well kidding I feel like drones and aerial surveys of these animals has really changed the game with how well you can calculate that and their tag data also is getting really good from underwater on the whale yeah it seems like I don't know why but it seems like the way whales feed and what they're feeding on it seems to be a big topic nowadays kind of jumping back to the gray whales another thing I learned back from another Cascadia talk because we always assume gray whales or feeding off the bottom and stuff like that but if the food's there there is the capability of them going they've been seen eating mice it's shrimp you know and and krill so they will take advantage of whatever is out there yeah and even like our humpback whales not this population over here as of yet I don't know if they do it but I do know the once back east will often go to the bottom of the sea floor if those sandy hills are over there they've noticed that they've seen a lot of abrasions on the side of their mouths it turns out they will actually kind of head to the bottom two so one of the things that we thought they won't do you know these animals might do sometimes kind of like those days when people ask you do blue whales breach and then next thing you know you see it happen I still don't think they breach I know it's crazy because like I always think when you think of a breach I just think like 3/4 of the way of the water and they were freaking out you got a photo you kind of got a 5 we actually had a passenger you get some pretty good photos no one's fight the good breaches happen before we realized what it was really happening am i you know myself and the captain weren't it well I was going breach you know and then it was happening multiple times with more we stared out like wait this is a really really bulky well you know that look gives a streamlined as a humpback because we got closer and this thing before we realized what was going on breached multiple times and although probably close to you know about eight times or so luckily a passenger at the bow was smart enough to take pictures from a distance and we got to it realize oh yeah you know that was a blue preaching and these were yeah you know not a chin slap you know not just spyhopping it was you know two-thirds of the whale those first few breaches were about two-thirds of the whale coming out of the water and then the first time I saw one breach was actually with my buddy the other Eric had a long beach over by the oil rigs so yeah blue will come out of the water there too so you know you're out in the water long enough you'll you'll see some of those things that people tell you what happened well what happened just when you think you got him figured out they prove you wrong yeah I remember this one day we were watching like I don't know five to seven fin whales and they were going 15 plus knots no problem we couldn't keep up with them on the on the regular whale watch boat there was a Zodiac keeping up with them they ended up going like from Laguna Beach all the way out between Catalina and Palace for days like they went far and a fishing boats other other and they just kept going and they were just poor they were like porpoises yeah they weren't like yeah they got their chin down the water yeah yeah I've seen him do that somebody law we couldn't keep up with them one time we tried to follow on when you're not keeping up with a 60 Plus foot what easily you know yeah I'm actually seen yeah the fin whales one will that I've actually seen porpoise out of the water before and that was yeah beach also some killer whales harassed him for a few minutes and they were out of there and speaking of a fin whales Caitlin you might have saw this too I think some of our start in California listeners might be interested in this it turns out that we might have like a resident population of fin whales I don't know if you read that poster that was very different than the Gulf of California yeah yeah yeah something that stays here stateside not you know down down towards Mexico so they go although same ones that are here Monterey or no well that's one thing I was wondering cuz I actually got the you know the information of the person who did the work and think it'd be interesting to kind of you know get some of our far those of that person to see if they match up yeah I always felt like I mean I don't know but they kind of just follow the food around so they could be here or yeah I mean so so little is known about fin whales because they spend most of their time offshore that I think we're really just barely starting to tease these things out actually some of the books that you'll read about that described fin whales like if you have a marine mammal encyclopedia or something like that they even speculate that fin whales may shift their breeding location based on prey like based on food availability and they communicate that to each other kind of like on the fly because we don't we really don't know we don't know where is their breeding location we don't know yeah that's just like that's so crazy to me there's also I feel like they are always seeing fin whales and Sea of Cortez and that yeah that's a particular population that strictly a second California I think it was a 15 year 2015 marine mammal conference there was a poster that said there is definitely a resident population in the sea oh yeah yeah that's this right here isn't it is pretty interesting yes maybe no I like the green sector I'd like to get them some photos what we see here in the Central Coast for sure okay so thinking about jumping backwards towards the baleen again not only does the baleen kind of tell you what whale specialize in because each whales each species baleen is unique based on what they feed on it also provides a record of the whales life and some species you can get up to 10 to 15 years worth of information about you know stress the whale received sometimes even like toxins in the ocean get kind of bonded into the baleen and then there's other ways that you can track those changes longer through through whale earplugs - so we're trying to as science is figuring out all these changes in the and who's gonna make it and who survived thus far it's kind of interesting to watch how they're how they're documenting that baleen is one way but also whale earwax is another way and that you just sent me an article I think while I was down south yeah yeah so just the baleen and the earwax kind of lay down in layers the same ways rings on a tree and the earwax actually stays in the is documented from day one of the whales life until the day it dies whereas baleen keeps growing it breaks it phrase off in the end the earwax you get a complete life history of the whale and a lot of what gets stored in there that scientists are using to assess stress in whales or like how the whales life is going is cortisol so with tree rings you know you look and you're like oh well when the rings thin there wasn't a lot of water when the rings are thick there was a lot of water there was a lot of growth but the earwax if there's not a lot of cortisol then things are going good there's not a lot of stress because even humans have this cortisol is a hormone that gets released in our blood and in fact when we're stressed and it also gets stored in earwax in whales and so if there's a lot of cortisol in the layers then it was very very stressful and you can see in some types of whales and depending on which specimens you get you can see that onset of the Industrial Revolution you can see the whaling era you can see different toxins that were up out in the ocean like pesticides I don't know if they found DDT in yeah actually the lot of people who have been studying chemicals have looked into different animals and they've noticed that any animal that comes close to California gets a certain signature of chemicals a combination of chemicals that ends up in their body it's I think they just simply refer to refer to as the California signature think they were doing something like testing what some animals down in San Diego and yeah they noticed you can kind of figure out an animal's migration pattern or how much time it's spent in this certain area by the amount of certain chemicals that are in their body because they know where these chemicals kind of have been coming from a worker concentrated in California's coastline has a unique signature that will you know show up in an animal's body mm-hmm and as the oceans get noisier as as humans continue use the ocean in different ways they're seeing more and more trend towards just higher background levels of cortisol and well bodies and their blubber in their blood and then in their ear wax so it's definitely something to think about it's kind of kind of sad kind of a bummer we're we're stressing whales out at a new threshold because of all the noise we make in the ocean but it is interesting to know that after a whale dies if you can extract that you can get a complete life history of the whale from something as bizarres earwax you think it's for sure the noise or can it be that like I mean I don't need yeah less food causes more stress so more cortisol will show up so yeah being chased after by you know someone with a harpoon the amount I'm about about August goes to make cortisol go up so that's what's causing that signature to show up in these animals I wonder if like one traumatic day could show up in blood but I think probably for it to show up in that earwax it have to be weeks to months like that whale died got hit you know the calf or the summer which ended up being okay we saw a couple months later do you think like that's something you could try you could read I can stress from that day maybe it depends on the list I guess the severity of the injuries if it took a long time to get over the injuries like six months or something yes probably would show up in that layer but definitely if you were to test that little caps blubber for the first few weeks after the collision the cortisol would be very high science yeah earplugs not only can I tell you the animals you know stress level health but also age yeah yeah so yeah you can age you can age whales through earwax which is I think gonna be interesting as we try and figure out maybe age whales with biopsy samples they're trying to figure out if there's like a way to run the genetics if you can tell how old a whale is and so the earwax can kind of provide some ground truthing to that I mean you can't extract earwax from a living will you have to wait till the whales that they were saying that the the wax obviously wax is such a soft substance you know doesn't hold up as well so you know your readings from it especially age are gonna be obviously a guesstimate not exact do you think that maybe snot bot maybe some age from that yeah running the genetics of the cells that are coming off when the whales exhaling is is one way it's not very accurate there's definitely stuff coming out of those blow holes we saw that yeah yeah a lot of different things coming out of there in fact we used to always say when you see a blow you know or spout that it's a number of things it's a little bit of sea water obviously it's gonna be a little bit of vapor and also a lot of it's gonna be mucus and also some of it including it you know and that mucus is gonna be a little bit of bacteria so that's why these snot okay blow samples are so important because you can still get cortisol from it you can get a big snapshot of the animals health because some of that bacteria might be you know something that's obviously bad bacteria and you can might be able to tell if the animal has an illness or not but there's a lot that these whales leave for us that can actually give us us a health assessment of the animal and even their their feces their poop oh man that's all we can do in that hole no talk on that that will give you stress level that will give you you can even get determined if the animal is a male or female from that you can even tell if the animals pregnant just kind of like a stool sample that's left by you know your dog that your vet usually requests or hey even that's some humans sometimes school give you a great health assessment yeah and have you ever had to wash whale snot off your glasses my camera it's gnarly I tell people like if we happen to have like whales not drift over to us from the boat or we get like a friendly whale or something I'm like wait to wipe your glasses off until you get to soap and water because smearing it or you're sure it's not gonna help because it really is mucusy it's pretty gross speaking of stuff coming out of bull's eye I filmed that ca1 and that lone male that went down the coast and I have a video of him launching like a big ol snot or mucus just like I did in like 60 frames I was like collected it was a snow or something yeah probably just coughed it up I thought maybe something was like right you know resting like right where the water kind of rests on top there blow but I was like that's a lot of yeah man happens sometimes you never know I ever actually seen a scene that'll get launched into it yeah another atmosphere by a humpback whale was the funniest thing ever seen I don't know this video Slater had that definitely looks like mucus god that's my next goal is to get a scene head oh yeah it's actually our buddy Shane blurry picture I don't know it's a song it was most comical thing I've ever seen was that here yeah was here in Monterey I've never seen something get launched Ohio words not expecting you to breathe em the bird gets blown off course oh yeah I have so many pictures of like you can see they can take of the bird well like stop and Express I mean its back and try to like stop his tracks yeah I've seen but I think our kids get hit I think the best all-time snot story of them all is has to be when me and Slater are on the ACS trip that one here this lady we had a friendly whale for three ladies that was a blow no bow honestly yeah that we had a friendly whale for well over thirty minutes it actually left and then came back to the boat twice and there was another whale that was actually hanging out just off like a hundred yards off from that one just like what are you doing and his friends just rubbing himself on the front of our boat and these three ladies were were like just enjoying the view and it exhaled a forgot you should not ever ever put your head directly over the blowholes of a humpback whale that's how close the whale was so I'm going to bond this next month and I'm like yeah you actually have to time that when I went yeah you have to learn how to time that some people will take those storm shields with them but you'll realize they'll be more more cumbersome to actually you know adjust you know your camera and stuff like that so just just time it really well yeah you're gonna get hit and what else not yeah there's some people to dream come true yeah I'll write a book you guys heard about the Nikon story but yeah I got started on a lot I think my first year in Baja and it actually caused some issues to my camera so I took it to a place to fix it and the first thing I the guys mouth when I you know I mean when he wanted to tell me what's going on phone he's like have you been around saltwater saltwater and well snot you got like oh that's what it is yeah be careful with your equipment yeah yeah unique substance and their breath can smell too and that's actually from the bacterial population in their lungs which is how this not bought project all really came about I go I try to go live on Instagram while I'm on the boat or Facebook and it's funny because they'll hear everybody be like you what is it [Laughter] and if you're downwind from a humpback or especially a minke whale or actually most of the bathing wells there's much anything yeah they all I don't think I've ever smelled I thought blue whales I just graze I've you know obviously because they're probably girls are smelly yeah what do you think it smells like on three one two three rotten rotten asparagus rotten broccoli that's what I tell people I just like saying poop rotten it smells like you need to going back to farm like Brussels sprouts and broccoli yeah better rot but the smell is helpful for nosey you have been well watching Assoc out here towards the Central Coast man there's days we cannot see an animal but yeah well hear them and smell them sometimes so yeah smell those give us a clue that they're out there when it was foggy this summer sometimes I would tell the captain like I smell a whale we have to be close yeah many times actually I mean yeah we found so many that's how you find whales when it's foggy smell them Hyrum we've even uh yeah one day yeah we actually followed those sea lions too especially during the summer when you get so much feeding going on out here yeah one day we did that that worked we had a foggy day with John I want to say this last summer yeah and we had like we ended up seeing like four or five blue whales it was complete leak pieces like yeah it was just fog everywhere he looked and we just stopped a boat and we listened we went to an area where we knew you know the whales had been like off the canyons edge and stuff and then we listened and we ended up finding three or four blue whales or four or five blue whales a couple years ago it was foggy and smoky when we have a big fire here and Victor and the whales were right outside point-p nose and so we would just drive out there and just stop and there was so many days in a row where we had to listen for the whales that you could start to tell the species apart based on the sound of the inhale you'd be like oh that's the small inhale that's humph well that's a huge it sounds like a cave filling up with air that's a blue whale it was pretty pretty cool like a wind tunnel yeah yeah and speaking of whales making noise where we live here in Monterey we have a hydrophone that's out in the ocean in the middle of our Canyon here what is it like I don't know how about ten miles out well it's about I think it was 18 miles out so the cord itself is over 30 miles long cuz it has to follow along the edge of the canyon even make sense it's not going straight yeah it's got kind of following the edge of the canyon I just hooked up last night but it's I think it wants 218 miles out pretty much out towards them of the mouth of the bay and it's it's run by minbari which stands for the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and it's out at a location in the canyon called smooth Ridge and it is a stationary hydrophone yeah and it looks like in their description on their YouTube channel it is 3,000 feet down a thousand meters down and it's cool because it live streams to YouTube through minbari so youtube channels so we get to listen to our whales no Erik listens and then he calls us and lets us know when something good is on there we talked about earlier how you know obviously there's days that man the weather is bad your trips got canceled you can't work or you just can't get on the trip you booked you know but you really need your well fixed your well fixed you don't want to go outside this hydrophone once again set up by and barrio or known as the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute is available to the general public on YouTube I think a few of you out there might have clicked on it I know I try to post on there and when I do I'll wake everyone up in the middle of night like Caitlin and Slater and my friend Kate let them know what I'm hearing but we've heard things like sperm whales beaked whales and humpback whale golf is alive dolphins sea lions even sometimes obviously that's another way especially late at night you hear them all barking yeah above water they also make a lot of crazy sounds yeah I think it was eerie with you member that one night we almost thought we heard like gunshots a repeated oh yeah and we thought that maybe yeah we talked to me well we thought maybe they were steel bombs bombs marcel lachemann a lot of times commercial fishermen and they're allowed to they throw steel bombs in the water so that the sea lions scare away from the nest yeah it may or may not work sometimes yeah they probably if you guys don't know yeah we here in the Monterey area have the best kind of opportunity for fishermen to load up on market squid so when they're out here the the sea lions want to join in and the commercial fishermen actually used these little firecracker like little objects that are used to scare away the sea lions they just simply light them they're all over board and they sink down a few feet and boom and yeah we'll hear them yeah sometimes actually a lot of the time pretty much every day you can hear a cargo ship on the hydrophone - as their protein or leaving the port of San Francisco sink of Rumble yeah really low Rumble sometimes it's also nice on the You Tube channel it shows a spectrogram so you can see if there's a sound you can also see the pick up of it and there's like a secondary low line that's the cargo ship usually going by and we didn't mention this species of animals you can hear some of you might have heard me say blue whale and for those of you who are a big old acoustic nerds are probably like that's not possible Eric how can you hear a humpback on the same you know frequency as you're hearing blue whales well what and barri does is they actually even though the the stream is live on their end they actually delay it let's see delayed about 20 minutes they actually way I have a way of processing it where you can hear some of those frequencies like the few those blue whale calls our hat you know so you they modify it so you can't hear it so that's one neat opportunity this hydrophone offers what is it like blue oz addy call there's a couple there's a couple yeah one of them it sounds really crazy yeah that's and if you go on their website or yeah on their website you can actually go and look through some of the ones they have recorded years yes yeah and they have like humpbacks with dolphins or they have humpbacks alone you can hear the clicks or the sperm whale humpback whale singing - we you found you called me one night with Eric called me one night with back singing on the hydrophone yeah some nights it's amazing it's it's just like putting on a concert or something like that so we we all never get yeah a lot of us never get I never get tired of listening to this thing so if you have it checked it out how would you search it well it's under Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute then they have in parentheses Ambari and it's labeled deep sea sound recordings live streams so click on that I know it goes down temporarily sometimes and then it pops back up in a day or so but yeah this is a neat opportunity for you folks who need your well fix even though you got even if you're landlocked you'll still have the opportunity to hear these creatures that we're talking about the other day we could hear the rain on it to memory oh yeah and you could hear the rain on the hydrophone yeah when I look it up I usually just go to youtube.com and then just type MBARI which has a note and then you can because they also have they have the the live recording and then they also have videos recorded on their channel because they also do like submarines and our ROV s and stuff here in the canyon and they have some of the you know the fish that you guys see on Blue Planet the deep-sea fish like that the angler fish or stuff like that they have that all recorded here in Monterey Bay from the Monterey Bay Research Institute yeah there's some really cool stuff that comes off the ROV s and then they have processed and described samples of sounds from the hydrophone and lots of good stuff yeah I just wish they made it like the the comments section or oh you know what it's back on the comments section is actually it was disabled before that it's back on I wish there was like someone you can talk to for or would be yeah or monitors more well there's so many questions about it as you put it on twitch and then you could comment and have something that means you'd have to have someone there 20 because some days you hear sounds like it almost sounds like you know they have to hide your phone on a desk or something if someone's moving it there's something like really mysterious sounds on there some days or that weird clunking sound we kept on hearing a metal box weird and it only happened a couple times at different intervals we couldn't figure it out yeah but this has been something really fun for the well community out here to to enjoy yeah like I told you it will cause a lot of late-night calls someone persons up to that you know get on that hydrophone if I don't hear whales I just don't go whale watching I wish it was like that easy though no I don't because the fun part is actually exploring because you never know what's gonna come up yeah another thing is the I folks if we're hearing wells yeah means we're hearing them but doesn't exactly mean they're that we means they're close so in in water sound travels really well as I always say on the boat because it has something to travel through it's capable of traveling traveling a thousand times farther in water and four times faster why is that because the waves actually have something physical the actual water to travel through so I kid you not some of the whales we are hearing could literally be you know if the conditions are right hundreds of miles away so it doesn't mean they're actually over the hydrophone but some days it sure does sound like they're over a hydrophone mm-hmm blue whales have been recorded communicating to each other across ocean basin ocean basins and that's been proven with the higher hydrophone networks all over the oceans but if you hear dolphins on the hydrophone usually that means they're pretty close to where the hydrophone is their sound doesn't travel nearly as far and you can hear them for a while sometimes yeah yeah and you'll hear them fade out too as they move out of the area now it's later not the hydrophone get excited beedo beedo that's pretty good impression killer are that the transients sound like crying people yeah scary yeah it sounds kind of scary to be honest yeah Rizzo's dolphin sound kind of creepy too they like make these really like almost like in the horror movie when the door creaks open they make those like creaking sound Rizzo's yeah a lot of our whales actually make some pretty creepy sounds but I think the ones that do usually aren't in the frequency we can hear I know there was recently that footage released of minke whale a spaceship so there's that that Mickey well and then what's the seal down and it given the bowhead it's like bowheads can actually sound pretty unique yeah also so if you guys are wonder what we're talking about yeah get on that youtube or any other well related website you might be able to find some of these vocalizations out there they're just it's amazing it doesn't sound like a sound that is coming out of our whales yeah the Weddell seal Weddell Widow little seal the first time I ever heard it I honestly thought it was like the lead into a Pink Floyd song it was like someone just did like a because it was a cute wet are a cute cute see oh I thought they just put like a little music ambient sound or something it was it's weird it's cool crazier yeah the one I heard he was just sitting on the ice I'm sure they came oh yeah the underwater sounds are like they sound like they're made by aliens it's crazy maybe maybe they are the whole time they've been studying us you know what I liked this episode good episodes a good one episode 3.1 oh yeah much improvement the new and improved episode 3 hey well should we end this right here I think so now you have some homework of things to look up on the let us know what you think well you guys thank you so much if you made it this far and thank you for listening to all the podcasts before this one and the one that got taken down if you did hopefully we won't have any more hiccups like that but we're learning and this is all new but thank you so much for joining us and if you guys don't follow us on Instagram it's wale nerds and leave us comments or questions or anything you guys might like to hear on the podcast and we'll try to bring them up in an episode thank you we'll talk to you next time all right thanks everyone

hello everyone welcome back to the well Nerds podcast my name is Slater and I'm here with Eric and Caitlyn hey guys hello and we are talking science today and we're just making stuff up probably at least I am by the way what I didn't say that in the intro no that was our third intro and I still have something else so I was we were actually just writing down ideas of later topics and then one of them got me talking about this animal called pakicetus yes which is a previous version evolutionary history whales so we're talking to dinosaurs and I know either neither of them are paleontologists no but they have read a lot on this staff but I like Jurassic Park it's like one of my favorite movie well wait so where did this whole practice see this fascination come from well I read a book actually I didn't read it I listened to the book and it's just in the book it talks about the past present and future of whales and in the past talking about where they came from and how they came from land to the sea yep and went back and forth right yeah so let's go even further back than that so some years is 505 million there's this 45 I think it's like 45 million years is when they started going back to the water so before that like the fish came out onto the land all these different land animals came to be and then about 45 million years ago the land mammals started going back to the water and that's where we're talking pakicetus hit the scene like 45 million years ago and it was this animal that went in and out of the water and it was a freshwater animal and its nose was like it's what are now blowholes it was at the very tip of its face and it still had four limbs and a really strong tail and I was really something that the only thing that even gives people a clue that it's a well relative was something about the ear bones or something like that yes bony wall around the middle ear is like the thickness of it is what I thought it was because they had the even toes well that was discovered later pakicetus was identified as an animal that could go in and out of the water and was one of the missing links as we get to whales but then they looked at like the wrist bones and realized that that's the same wrist bones as animals called even-toed ungulate so like elk cows hippos hippos yeah I think hippos are what one of the animals that's descended or the same common ancestor and that's the closest one that's living today right mm-hmm the closest land version well its uses the water a lot to you so that's probably why they're so big yeah well kind of as you get as they are in the water more you know yeah and then as they went back into the water they specialized right because then you get dolphins which are small and fast and the hunt fast-moving prey and then you get whales that are just enormous but they're also very slow and they eat huge volumes of small things so they started to get really specialized as they as they use the ocean in a different way and we are looking at some images of skulls about 36 million years ago the nose started to move up towards the top of the head so more what we know today and so they it's kind of interesting to look at how they started to evolve to not have to pick their head up to breathe and then they started to lose their hind limbs and then their tails started to become their main source of locomotion so then also the one of the evidences I would say of them becoming mostly using their tail but then at one time they had four limbs it's these things called vestigial structures in their body so they do even whales today you can like if you see skeletons that are complete in museums they have these little weird things coming off the back of the whale skeleton and their their hind limbs their ankle bones that are still like in the body wall of the animal they don't they're not connected to anything anymore that's why they're called the studio but they still do have hind limbs yeah and then over time I know people used to think they were vestigial and the completely useless but I think Oh what maybe about five years ago or more or less someone actually figured out especially our male whales actually are kind of using those vestigial bones for sexual activities I'll just leave it at that science science I think it's just amazing how we can learn so much from the bones you know yeah I think no matter what type of animal you're in obviously looking back at the past is really gonna give you a clue you know what's going on with these animals and it's funny cuz you know you don't think of it this way but we're seeing like animals that are kind of like moving into water currently in fact if you look at like our sea otters you know you look at the front they got paws you look at the back you know they they got little little flippers so it's like mmm you know this is kind of like something that's in between you know heading into water you never know millions of years from how those otters might have something different up front imagine if they like ten feet bigger otters that's true what the book that Slater is listening to those referring to whales I think they said there was like over 600 variations of a whale that are extinct oh yeah already so think of how many things are changing and we're just a blip on the radar they're still finding a lot of new species of dolphins and whales all over the world I know South America is a big spot for finding large whales from the past and also later you might remember this back in Orange County still to this day when they're expanding those toll roads and building those new neighborhoods in South Orange County they're still finding dolphin skulls then there's like one of the kind ones that they just have found in that area and still trying to make it about I know it makes me want to go dig to actually you know what's funny you mentioned that I used to kind of dabble into this stuff I wish it got more into it but there is a place that's kind of world famous over in Bakersfield it's known as shark-tooth Hill and there was a museum in that area called the Buena Vista Museum and they actually offered digs to the general public on certain days in that shark-tooth Hill area and they're still finding you know marine life from the past over there you know that's probably not to say it's all dirt roads there but I've gone there myself I got it is yeah it is private land so you you're able to keep certain items so I do have a bunch of well verts from that area who else would have passed but walking around that area is pretty neat there was a 40-foot complete skeleton of a whale that was just unexcavated just kind of sitting there that they were protecting with these this barrier because I guess there's cows over there's kind of a ranch areas and they don't want them stepping over it but whales well ribs well mandibles were all over the place Shh there's an extinct type of mako shark their teeth are just scattered all over this area and to the point where you don't even to dig you can like look on the ground picking them pick them up in certain places but yeah Google shark-tooth Hill in the Bakersfield area no are the Buena Vista Museum and that place is a good resource for you know good whales from the past and they have a really simple museum it's kind of two stories I haven't been to it in a long time but neat stuff in there do they think that maybe all these things that cumulated in one spot because if a current that brought all these bones in there or do these things all because they not that many things died in just one spot yeah well besides okay so I was gonna leave me do this there's that place but in Chile right that has what's it called well they just are you talking about this era Ballena yes everybody yeah so they and interestingly enough they had a very recent ume which is a unusual mortality event of large whales it was like 153 or 135 no it was like say whales mostly there was some fin whales like what two or three years ago and they were like all just fresh like over the course of six months there's just like hundreds of dead whales on the beach there and so maybe something like that happened in some of those places but also the currents or the way the the tectonic plates moved ended up pushing all those skeletons together okay that's right because so what why do you know anything about that Sara Vienna while the whales are landing in that one spot I don't know we could make that's another topic only yeah I just remember them mentioning Sarabhai in a bunch and how the whales land there and still Wells are landing there yeah yeah I mean that's a whole nother topic we talked about dolphin speciation too when the Southern Ocean opened up and started circulating all around the Antarctic when the land bridge was gone things changed really fast for whales and dolphins in the southern hemisphere yeah and that trips me out to how that you know for South America and then Antarctica touch yeah the western United peninsula and South America were touching yeah yeah and Allison whales are well and it completely changed the way the ocean works in the southern hemisphere it rerouted all the currents because the water had new ways to flow what is that the peninsula that goes down you fly out of there when you go across Antarctica yeah well a lot of people fly it down into Lake you Schwein Argentina yes and then you can't actually fly down onto an article - I guess the Cheeseman's trip it's doing that they're gonna fly in and so crossing the Drake Passage yeah yeah because when I was talking about going it was I'm not but we're you fly it down to that chill a are you swaiiow and then you fly from there - yeah but a lot of places also they just cross the Drake Passage by boat and that's pretty gnarly I think they cross on the way back by boat oh they might be coming back yeah you're right I think so so Betty one day we'll all go to Antarctica and then we'll be able to talk about that yeah I think a whole bunch of our circle of well friends are actually next week isn't it for maybe one of them wants to come on here and talk about it yeah good idea just so you know if you're going on the cheese and Antarctica trip now you're on our radar and you can can you bring back a penguin please um just photos for me thanks I heard they're kind of smelly speaking of whale guidelines well didn't you have oh oh yeah speaking of the bones pakicetus how do they tell how old they are that's what I don't get it's like they're like 45 million years I'm like how do you know it's 45 million years like I can understand like a million but like 45 million it just seems crazy yeah some of it's actually just based on the soil you know the layer of soil these animals were found so you know for example when you go on a a cliffside you'll see that there's visible I can't talk right now but eventually you can see that there's a difference in the different layers of you know of sediment every few feet so like the Grand Canyon yeah a good geologist I mean I kind of dabbled it but then a good geologist can tell you the age those layers and stuff like that and there's actually charts for certain areas that will tell you you know the age of the layers you're looking at if they age the layers yeah I know some stuff they can do yeah you can use carbon layer carbon dating and then yeah what's funny is we should I think we might be able to find someone who's really good with paleontology because we're actually kind of in a hot spot here I know right off of the optos area that's kind of like a hot spot for whale fossils also a little bit further inland I know I think that's Scotts Valley area after 17 is also known for a hot spot yeah let us know guys especially if they specialize with you know marine mammals but basically how carbon dating works is they can watch a couple YouTube yeah watch it on YouTube they calculate the breakdown chemicals in the skeleton and then that that follows like a mathematical pattern and so you can then take a sample of the of the bones or whatever's around the bones that has carbon yeah thinking of something to do with the breakdown there's something to right you have to break down the carbon isotope break down yeah chemistry it's math and you figure it out yeah my favorites yeah that's the thing people we don't know everything but I hope this inspires you to look it up yourself maybe boy inspires us to look yeah might be have to do some looking up on the exact way and what an age we live in that you can just look it up on YouTube now and somebody looks yeah it's probably you know t-there's well it's probably YouTube video teach you how the carbon dating when we were in college that wasn't a thing yeah YouTube's been around since um yeah but not the availability of information like that thousand 19 - fun time to be a college student yeah but if you guys aren't interested in yeah old ancient whales or just paleontology if you're from California I know man the Los Angeles Natural History Museum has a great great exhibit featuring pretty much those some of those ancient whales I was talking about I know they have a display what pakicetus that we just were talking about and also all the cool stuff that everyone expects to see he no t-rex and all that good stuff in fact when I did dabble in paleontology I got to meet the guy a guy named Harley gar Bonnie who actually found a lot of those t directors inside that museum so that is we're lucky to have that in California Natural History Museum in Los Angeles yeah has anyone found well fossils in the Grand Canyon mmm good question I know there's see shells there's definitely marine animals marine fossils fish well google it google it or you guys can google it for yourselves yeah google it and let us know they won't put I mean I know in the middle of the Midwest I mean they fine you know marine fossils they find like some big stuff too like Mosasaurus you know dick thesaurus which are they find stuff in Vegas which yeah please yo Soares I know they've found in the California in the Midwest that's a the animal that kind of looks like what a lot of people think is the Loch Ness monster well all the way up to like most of Nevada was has been accreted onto the continent so like these little land masses that were out in the open ocean have slowly been smashed up against the North American plate and so that's how you get those marine things all the way out in Nevada and the desert sometimes I just want to go back to Pangaea yeah I got a flux capacitor my back where's the DeLorean no no dingy I was just gonna say I want to watch that movie yeah eighty eight point eight miles per hour we'll be there yeah and then we'll the podcast about it will a you know well I don't think I've actually found anyone find one bone myself and it was like the jaw of a coyote and it was in Big Sur oh that's cool I remember I think I called Eric and I was like am I out of touch this thing I don't know it's drawing ice on the beach but I honestly couldn't tell you what they're from sometimes I know they're from a bird cuz they're really porous but that doesn't mean someone wasn't eating chicken leg on the beach in the through yeah exactly every time it's crazy windy here there's like a hundred Birds on Pacific lovers point yeah there's a lot of dead birds on the beach number we mean you were looking for those owls the other day yeah there was there every every pretty much there was like one dead bird that represented like every species that frequents the the Monterey Bay oh it's pretty pretty intense and there was a sea lion carcass there too mm-hmm yeah which is it's kind of not unusual there's a lot of things they get unloaded into the environment near shore when it rains and so that can be a problem yeah especially right there in that spot where we were there's like the runoff from like next Embassy Suites no there's always that like yeah but if you guys never come upon marine mammal bones or a carcass yeah I steer clear of it just you know you never know there's pretty stinky and trust me that that smell well yeah it doesn't come out if you touch it which you should really should it if you of us have taken tomato bath yeah every time there's a stranding out here tomato yeah every time there's a straining out here I feel let's always go take a look at it and yeah if you get too close man that smell stays on you forever yeah and you're not supposed to target any parts from the animals now cuz they're federally protected fossils is a little bit different but they get it like if a gray whale calf Park oh no that's meat or something you can't take from it I know I mean Eric Eric and I went to that hump back in your app to app - it was it Aptos toast Aptos and yeah yeah really happy that PEC fin from that calf was still well there really yeah I was still close to 6 feet long I wanted to lay down next to it to make it to be a size reference in the house bigger than me and this was just a calf that Washington what was it like go make that our thumbnail I have a picture of you knew that whale yeah i think that i think the the length 20 like it's close to 30 feet yeah 28 i remember we they told us 30 feet before we got there we got there like that's dirty feet yeah well the PEC fin alone was like way like at least 14 feet so was it no calf do you know I think it was yeah it was for sure taller than me and I'm five seven and three-quarters hmm yes a younger whale but that was the year I mean we had that in the for doubt we had that gray well I think most of us gray well calf that most of us saw oh with the crazy rake mark yeah that was from a predation I think that we actually witnessed ourselves from a calf on the shore okay I think that that carcass I didn't even get a good look at it but it I think it was that one that I was filming from the drone yeah it let disappear because if you play a killer were attacking it right and then they just beelined away and everybody thought there was another kill in the bay they went over to that one and they're like a day the next day I like washed up on shore there was it pretty whole the next day it was the lower jaw was missing throughout the body I still have pictures up but yeah the lower jaw was missing there's a few chunks missing like towards the you know behind the blowhole area but yeah it was pretty intact but a lot of rake marks in fact I think this was the one that we saw some blue shark and some white shark bite marks on - yeah that's also kind of cool when you see on the beach and then that was the only crazy one that went all the way up to go see that blue whale that unfortunately got hit by that all the way up in Point Reyes and that was quite an experience 60 foot long deceased blue whales it lazy like the gasps acquit filled up and I like gross and I think it was already pretty it was already pretty cut up someone the RA checked it out yeah you guys might have I recall the pictures yeah they were like perfect rectangles of you know of this whale all over the beach and all the pleats were there it was pretty intense but I know this might sound kind of depressing guys but this is unfortunately the only way to some people even us you know get to see these whales up close you know a lot of people never ever get this opportunity so it's kind of a thing that if you get a chance definitely do it you really get an idea you know 50 feet when you hear it it sounds big but when you're standing next to 50 feet it really is you know a lot bigger little barnacles that you think are little barnacles yeah well I can you're mentioning that that humpback whale you know it's a smaller humpback well thirty feet in that that PEC fin you know was bigger than me so the PEC fin on the full-size animal it's like dang yeah so in fact that that blue whale I mean it was 60 60 feet but I mean standing next to it you're like wow it's unbelievable how high it sits off the ground and see the size of the ribs and stuff like that was it was pretty intense the humpbacks PEC fins - like body ratio are the biggest of all the whales but yeah but like the Blue Hose PEC fin being on the big animal is it still a big the PEC for anything on the blue whale so there's so smaller so big though yes we're not gonna lost it but I had a photo of a blue whale fin omona humpback in one frame yeah remember when the blue whale pooped on the humpbacks face crazy maybe it was - like - no I'm pretty sure I definitely have a fin whale and a humpback and I have a fin whale and a great while passing each other - in Newport is the picture that someone placed online of it wasn't even a humpback Peck but there were bones from a gray whale packing it was it was huge I'm trying to see if I can pull up for you guys but and in their pectoral flippers I don't know if we talked about this in another I think we talked about this in the last episode it's pretty much like your hand bow yeah we're talking with you there's different lengths of the digits which is pretty nutty yeah metacarpal bones pretty much similar to us but yeah gray whales having I mean uh humpbacks having that PEC fin that can be won through their body length is pretty amazing as I always say they look like wings scientific name means big winged New Englander because the Wailers first saw the these big winged whales and the Atlantic when they started wailing and they were like what the heck is this which the Atlantic whales have a lot whiter PEC fins like more lighter in color on top on the top on the dorsal side yeah so they stand out a lot more from underwater whereas our whales over here usually a lot darker people get mad at me when I say this but the whales like the Australian hump like the ones that that populations Atlanta population like they're the white on the underside and then on their PEC trans is really pretty [Laughter] our humpbacks are more stealth mode we had that one calf this past summer the member is all like wow yeah so you guys might be noticing that we're talking about how you could recognize an Australian humpback well it tends to be that here in the northern hemisphere we tend to have humpbacks with darker features and down in the southern hemisphere for some reason the humpbacks have some lighter features on the bottom they tend to have a lot more white on their undersides and their flukes and it's not only sometimes pigment or color differences even size differences on the boat I always like to tell people that we have the smaller blue whales for example here you know on our Monterey boats will sometimes see big blue whales in the mid mid 80s or so but down in the southern hemisphere there are official you know measurements of blue whales being about 98 feet so old whaling days but you know they lied about everything but I know talking to John from Cascadia I remember yeah they're saying to verify it as 98 but yeah I've heard that too about the unverified records of a hundred and 10 but mmm there's multiple species out there that actually show a lot of a difference in size even appearance depending on what latitude in the world on the earth great well I also feel like in the southern hemisphere a lot of the same like will have similar species like northern right whales and southern right whales the southern right whales have a lot more white on their bellies same thing with the humpback same thing with northern right whale dolphin minke whales whales have the door for a lot more right around the pectoral fin yeah on the body near the fin and on the fin they have like we say that ours have like little mittens yeah but theirs is like their whole flippers on this one even with our pinna pets sometimes for example yeah though we we talked a lot about the elephant seals the other day we have northern elephant seals and then you get the southern elephant seals which are immense bigger than are the ones we have here in California so yeah depending on what part of the world you're in the animals look different I always tell her well Watchers that too you know you're looking at a different population right now possibly from where you're from so it's not just you know you seen one humpback whale you've seen them all yeah you definitely haven't seen them all if you've seen one because it's quite a bit of difference when you're in another location didn't you see that big white glow into the water from the pectoral fin well especially with humpbacks they're such versatile feeders that they use different feeding techniques based on what they're eating where they are some of them may be a cultural thing too that like hey we all eat this way so you're gonna eat this way - yeah and people always come up to me on the boat and they're like oh well I saw humpbacks in Alaska it's just like I saw them bubble feeding so I've already seen them do that and then we're like well ours don't bubble feed they lunch feed which can look similar if you're just seeing the feeding behavior that's surfacing the surfacing part yeah but you're not seeing what's going on underneath the water is what's different like in the Atlantic Coast they do a lot of trap feeding and kick feeding and they will do some lunch feeding and then even watching our humpbacks feed on krill versus feeding on anchovies when it's at the surface a lot of times and they're feeding on krill they're rolling on their and they're really just like side scooping and then when they're feeding on fish they're coming straight up out of the water almost like a spy hot but what their throat full of fish yeah these animals being as smart as there are I mean I know people in fact we're talking about trap feeding I think I think last season someone might a witness they're trying to verify if a whale was doing it out here it certainly appeared like it was doing that so you know these whales they never know they they might eventually catch on and learn a technique that another population has already known about and you can always think of these whales as the different populations are having different cultures you never know they'll eventually catch up with the other population and learn that technique trap feeding never know what might happen here sooner than we think where it might have already happened yeah our humpbacks I like the way Ted Cheeseman explains it so the humpback whales in California may be one of the more emerging populations post whaling because they're very coastal population of whales there were easy targets for whalers and so I think we saw this huge bottleneck in the population and they lost a lot of probably culture and so they're rediscovering habitat they're in areas they haven't been seen before during human history as their populations recover they're also starting to me over the last five years I've seen whales just like try stuff I wish we had better like ID matches correlated like this whale has been here all the time and you've seen it use these different techniques we're not quite there yet with the data but you know we had a couple of whales blowing bubble streams this summer we had whales trying trap feeding yeah and there's a few videos actually of them doing the bubble streaming out here in the bay I have videos and that's what's so cool about having the technology of a drone is that we're seeing things from above that we would not be able to see from the boat and the water is honestly too green here in Monterey to really have divers or like you know researching it so the drone is one of the easiest ways for us to look into the water and see things like that and this summer yeah we did see some long bubble streams and you see that kind of stuff sometimes on like the breeding grounds like the male's will do some long bubble streams and stuff but this is different because this is on the feeding grounds and they're doing it around like near schools of fish yeah there's so much talk about this humpback population in the North Pacific doing so well that obviously when you have more animals they're just kidding because spread out throughout area and intermingling you know it's good to be more and more possible we we have been talking about the different populations but isn't there like one record of a Hawaiian well actually showing up out here yeah so you just never know one day there's one well yeah might be coming over going hey guys I know this yeah Ted Cruz with me I know cool route this way you've been talking about this belt net thing let's go to Monterey the path was like from Hawaii straight across to what is it Eureka that's right above us what's right below Oregon yeah yeah like Eureka Coast but it goes straight into there yeah there's also a theory about migration route that maybe sometimes the Hawaii Alaskan whales cut inland somewhere off the North American continent and then go back out they make like a v-shape so and John Kalmykia so it just says like the Pacific is humpback whale Playland yeah so they kind of just go where I want I mean they're the ones that you see offshore a lot too surprisingly I've seen them 350 miles offshore people say they like think about it halfway between Hawaii and you know anywhere on this this side of the coast do you think that they're finding food like in the middle somewhere - yeah I mean definitely not as abundant like here yeah there's a school fish I bet they go for it yeah why not take advantage of the snacks like snaps on a road trip yeah you know your speaking speaking of the middle of nowhere especially out here with Monterey Bay Aquarium they've been doing a lot of research with the white sharks out here and I think a lot of you have probably heard that the white sharks sometimes just shoot out to the middle of the Pacific what's known as the white shark cafe in between here and Hawaiian they thought you know why out in the middle of nowhere there's nothing there but they tacked some of those sharks some boats have actually gone out there and they see what's going on and it turns out there's more food than they thought yeah there's there actually is food out there there's a little you know ecosystem out there there's large fish even some squid out there for these white sharks to actually go after so Pacific being so big you never know there's some hot spots out in the middle of nowhere and it's kind of like the resident killer well southern resident killer whales they leave at the end of what fall like during winter time did this cuz the salmon head out mm-hmm they head off shore so but I think they say they do say that fishermen and you know people out there come across them every once in a while yeah when they're not inside the you know the fjords and all that stuff yeah yeah I mean it's there's so much we still don't know I mean I think one of the things that we bring up every few weeks is like we still have not seen a baleen whale give birth I mean all this technology think how fast the ocean is yeah almost like two weeks think I mean if that's what that was and yeah that's pretty close that's like a couple minutes off so in Hawaii off of Maui they were doing a regular I think a regularly scheduled drone flight for the University of Hawaii survey project and they just happened to fly over a mom and calf and the calf was really small so they stopped and looked at it and the mom still had like blood in the water while she was swimming the calf was really clumsy so they think they missed the birth by less than thirty minutes but still I mean we've never seen the whole process like we don't it's mind-boggling that and offshore killer whales yeah man we don't know hardly anything about him and I had the luckiest experience yeah seeing them and actually I was able to see them here in Monterey and then like less than a week later I went down to Newport Beach it was around Christmas time and I got to see them again and they were different pods like we know for sure because the dorsal but I mean like one time of year they say that they show up on the coast and that's if you see them yeah I mean there's so many days in the winter where it's been rough weather and what if they came by Holly wait they're all out there right yeah what if last week when we didn't go anywhere there's his officer killer whales playing out there for days yeah we got lucky in certain California though not one year they showed up by two days in a row yeah that was the same yeah I missed one of the second day I think alright mr. first day and got him a second yeah I was working at a point we chased where were we yeah we were just a few miles off of Catalina off of Avalon we collar to open the long beach boats and you know the Newport coastal was out there too and we got to see him they were going south and then next day you know we're like oh well you know they're probably gone cuz when we left them they're going south and next thing you know next day they popped up right and friends you guys should see me when I get a text message I'm like in my car pounding on my steering wheel cuz I'm like I'm gonna miss it they're gonna like these things are just sitting in one spot a lot of times they're traveling and they're going you know ten knots or 15 not yeah and and killer whales can either be the best thing to look at or the worst thing to look at yeah and that's just mainly because they can eat there either traveling or they're feeding yeah perfect example was that sighting I was just telling you guys about so you know I'm watching them off of off of Newport and then I have friends the only that I'm watching them and they're like all right all right are they going north are they going south one might be going north to like okay should I go to Newport should I go to Marina del Rey should I get a long beach of my hat I'm like go to Long Beach they went to Long Beach and they got to catch up to him and see him I was on a private boat in Dana Point and I got a text message all right now I saw a West Coast whale geeks Facebook post and they're like we have to see 850 ones in Long Beach I got off that private boat drove all the way up from Dana Point all the way to what is it Harbor Breeze not on their boat and then I got the safe with you want just like track in your car to the next nearest hardware to increase you know just drives are very stress like sweating you roll down the window then it gets cold then you roll back yeah so yeah these animals will usually travel 100-plus miles a day so I'm glad we all in the whale watching world network with each other and make it easy for her friends a good thing to do so that you can kind of have a better opportunity to see something like a blue whale or killer whales is look at the whale watch companies sightings log because if we're seeing blue whales five days in a row it's probably a good chance that if you come on that six day that you might see one so that's one of the best ways to look into stuff like that yeah whenever you do this to especially if you don't live along the coast and this is kind of you know one of those things that you are doing for a vacation or something like that don't pick just one trip you know I do what you can save up some money do multiple trips every time I go to look for wildlife I kid you not you know I'll save up and let's try to spend about a week or so in the destination also give yourself some time to actually enjoy the area - you guys are Jinxy my all day trips well that's a whole nother thing is like going out for longer periods of time - yeah yeah all day trips are definitely something that you guys do the experience if you can tolerate eight hours plus in the water and increases your chances to go find some good stuff and also gives you time to actually spend time with the good stuff if you catch up to it obviously right here in the Monterey area especially around April and then in fact I know someone doing that all day trip in April that's a good time to see Orca or killer whales someone actually just wrote me last week and they told me they were coming to Monterey and they said they had a five whale watching trips booked with all different companies that's cool like that's the way to do it for different companies like three different harbors I mean because sometimes the companies might be full on the morning trip and you can only get that from noon and it can go vice-versa so you know look as many as you can yeah weather also depending on where you are at is a big deal too especially for us the last few days yeah so I could definitely make or break your trip so definitely booked multiple trips if you can't no matter what type of wildlife you're looking for out there yeah we went out today and we saw five great whales yeah yeah I was rolling in windy yesterday was better right before the weather kicked up and then as soon as the wind started blowing during the trip that was it I hopped off that boat today and I like did a wheelie down the boardwalk like I'm gonna beat this rang because it was sprinkling up the walk when I got up the hill I started covering the other direction and I got so you could check my Instagram story I got wet yeah in fact if you guys book trips at a time you know sometimes you can kind of get a prediction of what the weather is gonna be but ocean conditions all man that stuff changes almost instantly at times different than what the land forecast shows a lot of people like I said I'm in the office a lot lately and people call and they're like well it looks like it's gonna be sunny and I'm like that doesn't always affect the ocean yeah learn to look to read a marine forecast if you haven't already folks I'll learn how to read the swell height and the interval that's really important also the wind basically what really cancels o.l watch trip usually is high winds and large swells had a close interval so if you need help reading that I'm sure there's a lot of resources out there or maybe we can even do a talk on a on marine conditions one day teach you guys how that read those NOAA forecast out there or windy and what else we got wind alert sound flow he'd even call the office like once yeah like not every day but you can once it gets within like four days or three days the weather sir the way the weather starts to get pretty somewhat produced somewhat predict yeah yeah by the week out my short and sweet summary is if the wave height is similar to how many seconds apart the waves are may not be the best thing if the waves are more than four or five feet high and then they're also only gonna be six seconds apart it's gonna be a pretty rocky ride so just that's kind of a quick way to assess a marine forecast but definitely call the office I mean most of the companies we've ever worked for the office staff is happy to give you a prediction within you know 72 hours of your trip that is some good information yeah and if you guys think you might get seasick definitely don't go on an all-day trip for your first go-around try to book with someone that does I get two and a half or three or maybe even just a two hour whale watch try that out so you don't lose your breakfast and lunch completely put yourself off from the idea of whale watching by going on a long trip and being really miserable for there had a friend I used to get thanks that guy Luke that came out this you got seasick his first time and then the second time we took seasick medication or prevention and he was fine yeah and there's lots of choices at the pharmacy too if you want to talk to a professional about what's yeah yeah I'm not prescribing you anything I mean we have some we have some tips and tricks but once you're on the boat the best remedy for seasickness is getting off the boat and and yeah [Laughter] getting sick over the rail and on the boat yeah okay we need to see something happier let's talk about weird stuff we were gonna talk about weird stuff like narwhal tusks I mean meds are we 42 minutes let's talk about the next episode we'll be talking about weird stuff okay I think we're gonna end it right here it's been a great podcast yeah that's fun yeah it's always fun to cover pakicetus dinosaur's bones that we don't know a whole lot about but we're gonna use some Google techniques and then southern hemisphere northern hemisphere I'll backs humpback vulture feeding killer whale science planning or whale watch trips yes dead whales on the beach if you made it this far thank you for listening hope you enjoyed this podcast again and we look forward to hearing your guys's feedback if you don't follow us on Instagram it's at whale nerds and thank you for listening thanks everyone thank you

hello everyone and welcome back to the wheel nerds podcast this is our 5th episode my name is Slater you know I'm here with Eric and Caitlyn hey guys hello and it is a beautiful day in the studio we are talking about weird stuff okay some weird stuff weirder stuff about whales dolphins utter sea creatures and just cool stuff yeah and I think Eric is really excited about this topic and he's gonna go first okay great yeah actually we've been asking a lot of you for your input on subjects and items you want us to talk about and one of my buddies over from Adana Wharf wanted us to talk about what's basically well vomit and it's also comes out the other end too and we'll talk about a little bit later and I'm talking about ambergris which is an item that comes out of sperm whales and it's often you know referred to as well vomit and what it basically is is well if you know sperm whales diet hey love eating squid bigger squid and squid have beaks big old beaks similar to a big old parrot and imagine having a bunch of those in your stomach and if they have to go out the other end it probably wouldn't be too comfortable so there is actually a substance that actually will coat those beaks and it kind of makes it easier to come out people often refer to it as well vomit but what it's kind of a misconception it goes out the other end - so the whales can eject it either from their mouths or from the other end so what's been going on with it it's something that if you look at the history of it it's been used for many things currently there is some value for this item because it is actually used by the cosmetic trade it's placed in perfume for some reason it makes perfume stick to the human body better and a lot longer there are some synthetics out there to take the place of the of the ambergris but doesn't work as well as the real thing and the value is pretty high I've been looking it up I mean her values all around the world and some older ones some newer ones I think the latest piece that was sold to a cosmetics company was about it was about three pounds and they went for about seventy thousand dollars I think I heard close to a hundred thousand before - yeah so depends on the piece and depends on the current you know demand for it but it could be found pretty much anywhere where there's sperm whales and there are people who actually go a hunt for it for a living I know there's a yeah they're always surfacing around there yeah also you gotta remember there's certain places where you know grabbing silver from a a marine mammal is not legal so if you found it in the US yeah you got to kind of leave it there and you'll be surprised you never know you might have walking by a piece out there it kind of looks kind like a gray rock oh yeah if you just smell a funny-looking rock it could be yeah it definitely could be and the places where it's legal yeah that people will give up people a lot of tips on how to find it you know one is smelling it and to have a weird feeling you don't want to smell it yeah it's not pleasant and then some people also will take like a paper clip and just heat it up and it's kind of poke the rock or what they suspected to be ambergris and if it obviously melts its ambergris and if you look up at the history about it's pretty gross you know I'm telling you it comes out of both ends of the whale it was used for incense at times it was also consumed by certain cultures so that's kind of gross to think that people used to do that this is a really weird topic you're weird are you ready so related to this firm oil that dwarf and pygmy sperm whales we actually just learned nice the Exploratorium the kochiya species they can sequester ink from the squid they eat and then they have like this other organ to store it in along their digestive tract and they can excrete ink when they're startled that's pretty nutty that one blew my mind but do you think it's just I give their startled they pee and it just happen it's just because what they eat yeah well they know that they found a rasa yeah when they cut open they did Annie cropsy of one that was on the beach and it had a sack off of the digestive system that was just full of ink and like they don't make it themselves they get it they somehow can extract it from the squid they eat and then they do release it when they start on their altar for it there are a few videos of them releasing it when startled which is pretty nutty ones just pygmy sperm whale those teeth that they have on them yeah they look really sharp and pointy yeah kind of scary but I guess the sperm whale's teeth are sharp and pointy too but it just doesn't look as Extreme as it does on the pygmy sperm whale those are pretty cool I definitely want to try to see those where can you see the pygmy sperm whales that I mean supposedly you can encounter them off the coast of California but they've only ever seen them dead there was actually a stranding of a pygmy sperm in Malibu yeah I thought there was one more recent than that could you imagine finding something like that on the beach you'd be like what yeah especially because I know what they look like now within like the last couple months I've looked at them but if I didn't know what yeah I was kind of new species I'd be like on a selfie video but yeah I just found a new species I've seen videos of killer whales hunting them off of like the Canary Islands - this past summer they are encountered I think in almost all the subtropical waters if I'm correct the door for the pygmy sperm whale I know they see the then call for Mexico you can see them off the west coast of the United States you can see them in the Atlantic so they're just very elusive we don't really know a whole lot about them kind of like beaked whales yeah another really cool species is the northern and southern right whale dolphins yes no dorsal fins yeah that's and it's cool because I've seen the northern right whale dolphins from all of us have feel very fortunate to be able to have them show up here in the Monterey Bay and it's just every time at first you're like oh sea lions and then you're like oh those are moving a little bit quicker and then yeah it's just it's crazy to see a moment out of dorsal fin it's awesome it's kind of funny yeah one time I was at the wheel of the boat cuz the skipper need to step out of the wheelhouse one time and it was like foggy but then the Sun was starting to come through so there's like this weird glare on the water you couldn't really see anything and a couple of them buzz the bow of the boat and it freaked me out I like let off the engines because what's happening in front of us I couldn't it was like this weird like illusion happening underneath the bow and I realized after the captain came back to the with hostel's like you know what I think we just had some more the ring well dolphins bow ride the belt but you can't see with the glare and so it just kind of freaked me out for a second I thought we were gonna run something over and then they took off that's funny one time I was driving the overnight boat and I was going between leaving from Newport I was right between Catalina and San Clemente and it's like 2:00 in the morning and I hear like like like not like that but like you know like them like come moving yeah I walk outside and it was pitch black but I just could have the deck lights on and you could see the like the comet offens glowing in the water that sticks yeah and it was just like shoo and I remember I like I like couldn't leave the wheelhouse obviously but I wanted to like show someone I get on the PA and oh my god everybody wake up 2:00 in the morning that's really cool that's something I want to see one time I was on the survey ship and I I slept through it I didn't even know it happened my fellow observers were like oh yeah we saw the dolphins in the bioluminescence last night I was like come get me yeah that's a pretty pretty cool experience that's another weird thing we could actually talk about is popular places to actually experience bioluminescence I know a lot of people who are at sea is are pretty interested in that or want to see that yeah I know too much about it other than we can see it in Monterey Bay the best place I've seen it is Elkhorn Slough and then on new moon nights I have seen it from the cliffs and Big Sur the the fuel or the bathroom dock or the pump out yeah back in here port B and Newport Harbor there one time I was eating a packet M&Ms on the back of the boat and I dropped one it rolled off and landed in the water and it made like a little blue-green likes you no wow yeah about a year ago me and Slater realized that we both knew of a consistent spot back in Newport that would would always have bioluminescence but yeah like you said it is a pump out station and they Peter a boner you probably know what I'm talking about yeah it's where they basically don't poop and it's not something where you really want to put your hand in but it's that was one consider my name's can go in it yeah and then here in the Monterey Bay I know who must have been lucky enough in the summertime to go into the Elkhorn Slough area and go paddle round there and when it's pitch-black and and find it bioluminescence you guys just went this awesome alright yeah we've gone I think Eric and I have gone every summer with 94 years almost yeah yeah three or four years in a row every year I think I've said I'm gonna go and then I don't do yes exactly I have to go but I've also seen in Puerto Rico when I was a kid I guess I think it's pretty consistent there that they like anchored to boats and then like put a tarp in between them and then you could swim under the tarp and it would glow while you were swimming I know like there's a lot of photos that come out of Tasmania and I'm sorry yes San Luis Obispo I think they have I go oh really yeah there's been like these people are doing long exposures off the cliff onto the shore break and it was all bioluminescent waves yeah last year we you could sit on the cliffs in Big Sur and see it too and I sat down there and watched a Carmel Bay - yes Carmel they had something about this time last year like every March in case you guys are I'll quickly go over bioluminescence it's just what we have out here what we're seeing in the Monterey Bay dinoflagellates a little type of plankton that usually when disturb create this light their own light and it's a chemical reaction within the animal I believe it's luciferin and luciferase they interact with each other you know and they create this bioluminescence and all kinds of different creatures out there habit some use it as defense some use it to actually communicate some use it to signal others some use it as a alarm it's kind of weird like they'll actually create bioluminescence to draw in a bigger predator to actually scare away what's going after them if you get what I'm saying so yeah there's still kind of a lot of mysteries out there about it and also it's kind of neat every animal uses it in a different way and a lot of deep-sea animals end up using bioluminescence and in a whole multitude of ways what we see near shore is dinoflagellates but there's a whole other suite of deep-sea creatures that use it too for communicating in the constant darkness and if you guys want to look at some of those creatures you can go to that place where you're talking about on YouTube and Bari MBARI and they have tons of videos of awesome creatures down there yeah they do lots of deep-sea work with our Ovie's and they've been able to capture some incredible stuff in Monterey Bay in the Channel Islands they do a couple other sampling sites around the Pacific pretty awesome stuff there was actually a short documentary also in viola glasses the other day I want to say it's on Netflix or something something about light I don't recall that some of you might have seen that already well detective not well detective but there's actually a documentary strictly about bioluminescence let's see oh yeah there's that there's something coming out just next week or this past Friday oh yeah from BBC - it hits the u.s. in a couple months but it comes home out on the 8th in the UK the whale detective about the whale that breached on the kayakers I was actually out that day and saw the aftermath we weren't being a we were on the oh they came and filmed them yeah and I found my various boats out here in the bay that's a muscle in his girlfriend that was crazy yeah oh okay what other weird stuff can we talk about I have some ideas that we could just run through quickly of like fun facts of weird things that some species have narwhal Narwhal yeah narwhals in their tusks yeah you want to go you go for it so there is a tooth believe it or not that grows in a spiral formation out of the front of their face and if you were able to look head on to a narwhal it is asymmetrical and the mant only the males get them and I think it's a secondary mature like sexual maturity characteristic really and then sometimes they get to so they'll have one tusk is the really pronounced long one and sometimes they'll have a second one a smaller one growing out of the front of their face and it's the left one is the longer one what there's actually two yeah well not all of them but it grows out at the left side of the face for most and then sometimes some of them will get a second tooth to erupt out of the front of the face on the right side what if they can feel that like you're going in right I feel like really long your wisdom teeth come in maybe it's just like this dull roar all the time the oil tea there are also nuts yeah but these are narwhal tusks for decades we kind of were kind of just guessing about their usage but over the years they've realized that there's a lot of nerve endings actually in that tusk so there is some thought that these animals can actually kind of like a communication think touched at us also there's some work that they could be using it kind of just you know literally just waving it through the water and kind of sensing conditions out there obviously probably temperature and salinity and all kinds of maybe even vibrations from from prey out there I would have thought they would use it like a school efficient walking back and forth and then pick up the dead never know they might be able to do that too I mean they live in such remote areas that the opportunities to study them are so far few between I think one of my huge goals is to go and there's this place that you just sit on the sea ice and like they just you know it's like they know it's a rather they come through I guess and they just come right between like narrow sheets of ice or two pieces of ice and go right down the middle of it yeah I definitely want to see did you guys watch Aquaman yeah if you blink you might miss it but there's a scene where Narwhal impales a guy like the there was blue whales there was humpbacks there's some dolphins I think there were humpbacks without tubercles I want to see you guys there I think there was super cools maybe in one of the scenes cuz it was like one scene that they were really showing up close and most I've never shown away far away maybe one of the animators got lazy further into the movie but yeah I gotta watch it too you guys you had gray whales in the Atlantic because don't forget yeah but it's obviously based in current time so unless it's one of those ones that went through the Arctic yeah yeah yeah but very quickly guys I just don't mean to go off subject but if you are interested about learning about more about bioluminescence and you don't want to read a book and you just want to watch something about it yeah I just looked it up it was on Netflix look up creatures of light that is actually a short little documentary on bioluminescence kind of give you the basics of what these creatures can produce and what they use it for so my other weird one is beaked whale teeth those are weird those are was creepy I had no idea until like not even a month ago that there and a half the poster on my wall that showed them little teeth stick out of there usually the males have the most prominent it comes up out of the bottom jaw and erupts like outside the lips and it's even weirder when you combine it with the fact that there's like usually a pretty healthy population of barnacles growing on the teeth so they have a little odd I don't even know how to describe it like these little pom-poms on their face but they're barnacles growing on their teeth and the male's will rake each other with those teeth and so you'll see like two long line parallel lines down other males bodies because they scratch each other as a way of displaying dominance with those but then you also have like the strap toothed whale where those teeth then start to grow up and over the top jaw and sometimes that's what ultimately leads to their death is that they like seal their own mouth shut with this tooth that grows over the beak it's just totally bizarre I mean they are suction feeders so if they can still open the mouth enough to like slurp up a squid then it's not a big deal but sometimes it completely closes the mouth yeah and back up to those barnacles growing on the teeth there's barnacles that grow all over the whale's body some of the whales mm-hmm like the gray whale or humpback yeah and those barnacles are actually what they call endemic to that species of whales so a gray whale barnacle will never be found anywhere else but on a living gray whale they don't exist on rocks they don't exist on other types of whales so they each have their own specific species of barnacle there are some other like types of like more like a gooseneck lookin barnacle thing that can grow on multiple species but those like classic big barnacles yeah there's only one freaky exception to that gray well barnacle some of you ELISA actually told me about this there was a killer whale calf that washed up a long time ago that has one gray whale barnacle really yeah I asked her about that but there's only one case everywhere a gray well part and call ended up on another animal they actually really tell the you can so the barnacle lifecycle is timed with the whale lifecycle so when the barnacles spawn because they're free spawning or they well yeah their larvae enough free-floating so they they spawn directly to each other and they're all hermaphroditic but the larvae after they've formed are floating and then they settle on new material to grow on they do that at the same time that the whales are in the breeding ground so their likelihood of landing on another whale is the highest and so when they come home from the breeding grounds is when they have the heaviest barnacle loads and when they're headed to the breeding grounds is when it's the lightest cuz they've fallen off throughout the whole year and the northern and southern right whales have similar barnacle subspecies of each other because they're similar species of each other and you can tell the last time that the northern and southern right whales interacted and had some kind of overlapping range based on the barnacle genetics as well as the right whale genetics oh yeah that's a pretty recent paper right that at one point in time they were together and that's and they know that because of the barnacles that are found on both yeah yeah they're able to crop rate the barnacle genetics and the right whale genetics kind of show that there was there was a more recent interaction between the two subs which is putting these things together they both Captain Crunch you know they must post grad students desperate to you know to think of something creative you know that is creative but it always yeah it always ends up helping helping science and it's yeah there was actually a big old paper about well barnacles that was released recently and it can kind of give you almost exact travel migration patterns of these animals to see what they've picked up on their bodies but there's another thing well lice that's another neat little thing that also pops up on these creatures and unfortunately it's something that you can't really see unless you're really close up on the animal but sometimes the animal the whale lice is on the animals and such great abundance you can't see them from a distance so you're just talking about our old buddy Scarlett right and big red oh yeah there's a couple it's so weird because I haven't seen whale lice since those whales and yeah the humpbacks in Monterey there's been like one that I've seen with a little bit of red but nothing like what I saw on Scarlett or the big red and I think there was another one in Newport but they want to I mean Scarlett was completely had to like tail cover it back up and tell the story of Scarlett because there's a there's kind of a reason why there's so much lice on so Scarlett I can't tell you the dates but was first seen May let's just say the beginning of summer and then she showed up with an entanglement mark Gerardo was the first to find this whales and then take out an entangled pack and something over the fluke as well and then they it was I think he was like bad weather and rainy that day and they lost the whale and then she came back multiple times but no one was able to disentangle it I think it just like wasn't working yeah and then she she left came back and then I happen to be filming her with the drone and she kicked she did a bunch of tail throws in like breach and then ended up breaking the rope or whatever and then she had nothing i I actually yeah so and I have pictures ever completely freed from the drone and that's how we kind of like verified that she was free and then you know she stuck around for the whole rest of the summer and she pretty much got healthy from what it looked like I mean all of her lights like I said it was from head to tail and then at the end of that it was pretty much back to normal just a little bit of spots so sometimes heavy lice populations can be indicative of bad health for a while sometimes it also like could be localized on the body like whales like scar back where it's just around an injury there's a lot of lice but sometimes when they're just completely head to toe in lice it means the whales not doing so hot probably cuz they're moving on so or - right if they're entangled yeah and then as they get better off times like you saw up Scarlett the lice load comes off so but I was just gonna leave that part I know that's why I got sad when I said Scarlett yeah yeah there was a few wheels down and sorry in California a few humpbacks I should say that we're kind of like local celebrities and also and they just you know mysteriously just passed that's weird because you know you get kind of attached to these whales yeah cuz you see them like it's in Newport when you see how I'm back well it's like you see that humpback whale and usually only maybe a couple that come through but like Wally the first one that passed was there like every single day for from like June to like the whole summer I mean in an Wilma that which ended up being Wally end up being a girl after we found out when she passed but they were then they joined together hung out the whole rest of summer fed together and then I don't know a couple months later that one showed up floating so there's at least three yeah hung out in Southern California that we the fleet out there knew pretty well that past is Wally scarlet and then there was evergreen who else I can't think of anymore it's kind of an interesting thing to think about for conservation though for especially scarlet like you look at you watch a whale that gets entangled throws the gear seems to get better and then still ends up not making it through the next like six to eight months so what does that mean for health impacts of an entanglement long term sea but I don't even know if that entanglement even had that much impact on our seeing that you know hearing stories where a whale carried something from like Alaska all the way down south or something like that or Hawaii or something crazy where they carried a trap all that way and still made it and then broke free or God doesn't but then we don't know if it lived through the night ever that's the thing so it's it's an interesting new set of questions we have and that's actually what Ted Cheeseman and happy whale is gonna work on for his PhD is trying to figure out what this long-term survivorship is there's whales like train wreck that you know of an entangled more than one yeah and he in is it girl or boy do we know I don't know yeah but that whale is a wreck literally but it's still rad well and you know it seems to be feeding here every summer yeah oh hey well ice wasn't there some talk that they can actually almost be helpful like in the scarbacks case actually be clean yes yeah so what I explained the world is the barnacle situation is a commensalism so the barnacle gets all the benefit it doesn't help or hurt the whale the lice is a mutual relationship so the whale and the lice get a benefit out of it the lice gets a place to live and something to eat and then the whale gets a free cleaning service for its skin and if you if you've never seen well lice up close before they're pretty neat I always described as car looking like a pink aquatic tick and their feet are like needles I mean that's how they really cling on to the whales enjoy the ride and it's believe it or not some of our larger whales out there are so big and have so many barnacles oh well I saw them I mean it's hundreds of pounds little creatures living on them and they're not exactly harmful as you can you know see but we're telling ya and there's even some thought especially we're like humpbacks out there that sometimes those barnacles are almost like I said that brass knuckles you know especially for the males they can kind of use them to treat them as body armor you know kind of whack under males with the areas of their bodies where there's barnacles is often the their chin area you know sometimes even some along their pecs so and that's kind of why you see a lot of times on like a male humpback you'll see a lot of scratches along the back of their body are just on the top side of their body and that's probably from the other humpbacks scratching yep barnacle charging up each other's backs with their chins rubbing across the back of the other whale like Batman he's so scuffed up one of the really old whale males we see in Monterey he goes to Mexico every year and all his tubercles have white scuff marks all over them he has a big mohawk on the back of his fin where it's just been beat up year after year after year even the top of his flukes are really white because of all those years in the competitive groups yeah and what we're describing here folks is when the humpbacks get into their competitive behavior when the males go out there and race each other and compete for the right to be with a female knew they beat each other up sometimes yeah those competitive boobs can be really crazy thing to watch to 80,000 pound 80,000 pound animal breaching on top of another yeah a lot of it I don't feel like they're breaching on each other they were definitely rolling into each other yeah but I saw more of just like long bubble streams diving I mean they would they would be going north and then they would be going south and then they'd be going east and and they were dive under your bow all four or five or six of them and like they didn't care they were just going like nothing was they didn't care about anything else around them other than chasing that girl around yeah it's pretty pretty insane and it's and it's kind of hard to like what we think would be a fast paced intense thing is slowed down so much in the water but it's still just as intense and that's like really fast-paced for a whale like life moves at a completely different speed when you live in the water and those things were moving a speed that was fast they were going and it's crazy because you could you could like leave that Liz Wells you know and continue on and watch you know like a mom and calf somewhere or whatever else was going on and those whales would be still going like aisles in the distance just preaching pecks lapping you know tail throws and just and it seemed like for over an hour yeah longer probably I'm yeah I mean I think you probably just do it off and on all day in Monterey when the whales stay really late like this year we had a few competitive groups and it's funny because I think what happens for the whales is they start to get this hormone surge timed with when they're supposed to be going for migration I think it helps cut down on their feeling of appetite but the food was still there in front of their face so they'd like get in a competitive group for like 15 minutes and then they can be together yeah get back together and eat you ate the last edge oh pretty funny though try watch him like figure out what they were doing and it was it was honestly kind of hard to keep track of him on the boat too because they kept changing direction and doing different things and splitting up and getting together but it was pretty funny I was like I think they don't know what to do eat or so chasing each other sounds like when we're watching pfaff and he don't know what direction he's I think he's at California trans yeah I don't know numbers 171 be right I think you're right sometimes I think he does that to mess with us he's like he watch me do you this and then you're like okay I'm gonna stay left cuz he's gonna come back for mile and a quarter to the right but so talking abouts just kind of finish the thoughts on the the lice and the barnacles gray whales I think is the best example where they have like a kind of a self-serving ecosystem they have such a heavy population of both that whenever a barnacle falls off and like leaves a small wound the lice are instantly they are ready to clean it up and then they're going on their merry way so they're kind of fun to talk about with people like they carry a whole nother ecosystem on their body with them all the time and I heard that I don't know who I heard it from what I thought that maybe they could accumulate so much lice that a kid could actually weigh them down if they were sick or something yeah same with the barnacles they could end up with such a heavy barnacle and lice load that it actually ends up hurting them yeah but it would most I could probably already have been sick yeah something slowing them down to live would accumulate that many barnacles yeah usually if the whales not doing good then that's another way to kind of diagnose their health they also get these weird things called Piniella which like burrow under the skin and sometimes you'll see like the back end yeah those are kind of kind of creepy at neat-looking yeah they actually you'll see something you know coming out of a whale you're like is that footlong coming out of it and bright red and yeah those are usually Piniella copepods yeah and they have them on fin whales as well right yeah fin whales are one of the most obvious that yeah I've seen one I was bad like it's kind of all over us yeah their skin always looks yeah from those Piniella yeah yeah it's pretty gnarly there's no one year actually and back in Dana Wharf me and just happen to be all about with Shane and we actually saw this minke breach and it looked like he had dreadlocks there were so many pinellas are actually they were all swinging in unison togethers yeah so it could be yeah like we talked about earlier they can be all over these animals that time dolphins that go to like warmer areas get these little cocoa pods on the trails on the tip of their dorsal fin dorsal fins on their flutes yeah yeah yeah that's what it is I'm sure knows I'm sure killer whales am too remember yeah long ones yeah um shoot I had something to say no sir I just it was really cool now they're gonna miss out what about remoras oh okay so I have a common depiction of common dolphins breaching with remoras on them it's pretty gnarly yeah yeah down here you know I should say up here actually yeah it's kind of a rare sight if I remember back back down south you have seen some of the the Blues you know have them and sometimes our dolphin would have them too depending on what species are more I don't think they get that big here but man back east man they're like okay maybe I stagger to that maybe even put three times that size there on manta rays sometimes and stuff like that so they had it they get pretty big depending what part of the world you're in back to that minke whale breaching that you're talking about okay tell me what you guys think about this we had this day in Newport right off Newport Coast like right where the it goes into Laguna Beach and there was a minke well that breach and then I swear to you like eight more all over the place minke whales not just one like in there and I have pictures of all of them doing it and then I had enough time to get a video of him doing it like all sorts of stuff and it was going on for a while like they were just continually breaching all over the place and I got one every was some like maybe like meetup something crazy to each other yeah that's many yeah it was like and you know Miki wants a breach that much I know other than that time I had one other time with minke whales breaching as the first time I ever was on the news this Mickey well breach like 15 times with his mouth open you can see the baleen our Miki whales Monterey hate us as never seen I've seen one in seven years I have only seen one yeah I haven't I mean I guess they see him closer to shore around 17 mile drive like a Sylmar beach area and I've had them like blow by me a few times if we've been in there watching other whales but I we haven't seen him for a long time really the last time I saw one was actually your family was on the boat your mom yeah your mom and dad and then there wasn't very many of us on the boat it was like holiday trip I think yeah and I think that's where we were right we were on our way down to Cypress Point we don't say we were off we were back in the bay and we're closer to like Marina Beach or something oh maybe we always used it so my first summer my first two summers in Monterey like 2014-2015 we used to see em off cannery row like every day and the passengers would never see them because we'd spotted my yeah 300 yards out and we try and slow down and look at it and it'd be gone yeah Mickey whales are one of the whales that I have to see that at least like two times before I bring up to the passengers just like harbour porpoise yeah I think a lot of us naturalist out there know and they can get kind of friendly I've had times where minke whales are like bow riding on the bow I have it from the drone on the western private and and I know a couple other people that have video of it flipping up on their side going back and forth underneath the zodiac and looking at its eye yeah so yeah they can go both ways but usually they're like 80 percent elusive yeah they're like 99 percent of one percent close encounter well I've seen photos out of Iceland to where like they'll kind of like spy hop or like put their chin up a little bit and look at the boat and stuff but yeah Monterey Bay I've never had an encounter like that never bigger buddy's done you would have that one follow them right yeah that's yeah yeah that one follow me twice on that boat yeah if you folks are wondering why these main keys are oh you know why US naturalist don't mention them until we see it multiple times you're used to seeing a spout or a blow from a whale Miki's often times even if you're looking directly at them you won't see much of a visible spout or blow they're really stealthy at times so you'll be surprised even at an animal that's 30 foot long can be kind of difficult for us to point out to a group of passengers on board sometimes you'll smell them before you yep and they think it's really fast they do have a pretty substantial dorsal fin that's fairly noticeable but they're so quick on their surfacing that if you blink you miss it yeah definitely I have one other weird whale thing go for the unfused vertebrae in the necks of river dolphins I think the Lukas have something like it too they can turn their head in so many different directions because they hunt and like the river dolphins hunt in mangrove habitats and fresh water and rivers really Brown I think yeah yeah and so they can like twist all through the mangrove roots and stuff and that that's something that's unique to them is that they can have all that maneuverability in their in their head I want to plot something with the other River Dolphin the one that's extinct but that's one of the ways when you learn how to like assess the skeletons if you don't know what type of animal it's from you look at the vertebrae in the nation' if they ate squid they have such long beaks they have something to hold on to you know we almost forgot about this we've been callosities right oh yes callosity xand right whales what's a callosity um so the those things that look like barnacles above their eye on top of their head and then lining their chin it doesn't actually line where they're products it looks like such a well one thing you can point out is they actually will cost Lisa local we'll put a plain simple there are these these groves that are keratin that are found on our our right whales and it's usually around the head area if you look carefully where they are it's kind of like where facial hair would be like when I browse be where beard would be where a mustache would be these are really tough thick gross of this hardened keratin that are along these animals heads and they're really unique to them so you see animal velocities you definitely know you got a right well in the area in fact that's how they realize they had a right well that a few years ago in San Diego instead of a gray well and there is some thought that it is actually something useful for them they can use it as a tool I think Kaitlyn you were talking about with about that oh yeah they can use it they think they can use it to help break through ice because when they feed in the polar areas sometimes they get stuck in areas where there is a lot of ice cover and then they have to find they have to make an air hole to be able to come up and breathe and so they can punch through the ice interestingly enough though bowhead whales which then all their time in the Arctic do not have callosities but we learned that the ACS conference back in November in Newport Beach that they can break through ice up to half a meter so a foot and a half thick and they don't have that same keratin growth on their head like right whales yeah that's really interesting why they wouldn't have it and I mentioned how it's made out of keratin the same stuff your fingernails and air are made out of it and I don't forget whales dolphins are mammals just like me and you so a lot of them do have hair on them what we often refer to as vibrissae so if you ever get up close and personal with a whale especially younger ones you will definitely see that care on them I know a few of our listeners have probably gone down to Baja and gotten face to face with a very well especially the calves you'll see you'll see these little hairs all over their rostrum area yeah they have like little whiskers it's pretty cool so yeah mammals they do have hair they're warm-blooded they give birth to live beyond they produce milk whale milk is like that's a weird thing for tea to say that your said fat yeah it's like it's kind of like cottage cheese so because they live in water it can't be just like a straight-up liquid because the calf would never get any of it so it's like kind of chunky so the calf can kind of gulp it up yeah we do know that some of our dolphin actually have a kind of a unique shaped tongue when they were young to allow nursing they'd be a little bit easier if you are lucky enough to go inside of a young elephant's mouth and look at its tongue its tongue has these weird little threat fringes on it and when it does is the young dolphin will actually kind of roll up its tongue like a straw it creates pretty much a straw and that allows it to actually get mom's milk with greater ease would you see any of the milk when you're in like Baha I never experienced that but I'm sure some lucky people are probably seeing it before yeah there's always feeding going on but you know when the boats are round they're usually like hey let's go play with the boats instead of like I'm hungry I've heard of some people that either in the areas where you can swim with humpback whales or in Baja they've seen it like floating it's kind of just like this chunky fatty looking stuff yeah so a lot of similarities to us oh and back to that hair we were talking about Aquaman and lack of tubercles earlier on that humpback whale so if you don't know what tubercles are if you look at the head of a humpback whale you see those little bumps and those bumps are actually a big old hair follicle called a tubercle and they're actually you know obviously it's gonna be a little hair at the end and a lot of thought that they're using him you know to kind of feel around him as my brisket you know vibrations in the water and stuff like that vibration caused by huge schools of anchovies and curl out here in the bay so a lot of use for that hair on these animals bodies well I think that was some pretty cool and interesting stuff about whales today the ambergris the hair normal to barnacles the whale lice the narwhal tusk is are pretty cool wanting sex a lot of cool stuff today I hope you guys all enjoyed that I had an awesome time talking with Eric and Caitlin yeah we definitely can sprinkle in more weird whale facts as we remember them throughout future episodes but we wanted to try and get a whole bunch of them out at once because they are there are some pretty cool things that whales have yeah thanks guys for listening and gotten some pretty good feedback from people and also if you have any any other things that you think we should bring up subjects or weird things you wanna learn more about marine mammals or anything else in the ocean let us know well thanks for listening if you guys don't follow us on Instagram its whale nerds on instagram and thank you so much for all the feedback and everything we'll see you next time thank you thanks everyone

hello everyone and welcome back to the well Nerds podcast we are on episode 6 I'm here with Caitlin and Eric hey guys and today we wanted to jump right into some questions from Instagram one of the questions I got today was from someone named Brooke they asked what is our favorite whale species and why and Kaelyn it looks like she wants to stop just cuz I know mine right off the bat people ask me on this this one on the boat a lot to baleen whale my favorite is the fin whale because they're so difficult like I should do the baleen in there so now she gets to whale - well okay my favorite dolphin I shouldn't say - yeah my favorite dolphin is the northern right whale dolphin so I like the ones that are unusual ooh giving you some ideas huh I like the ones that are like you don't not everybody gets to see him that and we don't know a lot about him that's why I like them they're mysterious about you Eric neat people always laugh at me for this one I like gray whales - my heart a lot of people I hear out there like very boring but yeah I actually like them a lot I think the main reason why is they're one of the few whales out there that actually show you that they're curious about people or well we don't know what they're thinking but you know they'll actually interact with people especially you know when they're out there in Baja and those lagoons where they're raising their calves so that's one reason why I've always been kind of fascinated by them and always always love learning more and more about them every day I see them they're very cute little in the middle of March after I go see these maybe maybe my answer will change but I think I really like the humpbacks super acrobatic they're they make trumpet blows often they just do a bunch of cool stuff that are super unique and I think they're one of the most active whales that we see definitely they're definitely a crowd favorite and I do like seeing them on the whale watch trip because that they're very consistent and so people like them their sheer numbers are a good thing - yeah so many of them I think it's also that whale that I probably spent the most time with well that they great well I've seen way more but the humpbacks you get to know some of them because they come and hang out in the bay like it's true that give seen you know some of them four or five years or four years in a row now yeah pretty cool yeah that's true and there are some whales that have some pretty unique personalities like fran the humpback whale she's super mellow like she'll just take a nap next to your boat which is not necessarily the most exciting thing but it's pretty cool well we'll just sleep next to you and just hang out I had to get up a good encounter with Fran with Eric yeah we ran in Moss Landing member that yeah we had Fran breaching and stuff like that but she's a whale that we all look forward to seeing come back to the Monterey and I believe her her mother was actually a whale that they saw at the bay and then she's here and you never know maybe one day she'll come here with a with a cat did she not have a couple years ago when I first moved here I don't know another cool whale that I always like to see for humpbacks is Batman just cuz he was a really cool story he's really recognizable he's seen very consistently in the breeding grounds every year and he's like very easily he's a good topic of conversation because you can see all the scuff marks from the competitive pods you can see how unique his tail is he has a pretty cool story about how humpback whales I want to say he's one of my furthest distance travelled IDs like from Mexico up to here over that man I think or just maybe he might be the oldest one that I have yeah he's definitely an old whale he's older than me any of that yeah I think he's older than all of us should we do one more question from intern oh yeah [Music] what is your first whale encounter or when did you and Kat when did you start like getting whale fever and that one is from eco 21 not eco twin to maybe go 20 you can send us one later um well the first well this happened somewhere about the same time maybe this one was probably first the first one I ever saw was Keiko and I think I really liked him I don't really remember too much about it other than my mom showing me the newspaper like oh look he's coming in the truck to the Oregon Coast Aquarium I thought that was rad I was crazy and then I do remember seeing the southern resident killer whales from land that's the first time I remember seeing whales and then gray whales along the Oregon coast and I think really not until I was in college did I really become obsessed with whales I liked all animals but whales just like Jim Sue Mitch's class at Oregon State really got me hooked and for me I'm been pretty lucky in my life I've always lived you know it's just pretty close proximity to the ocean group in a town called Redondo Beach all you start in California's for Californians now I assume you don't because I'm here in Monterey but yeah I was just growing up on the water and gray whales just always playing the surf and what's kind of weird we were all Beach kids and they took us whale watching anyway so remember I think it was actually on the Voyager a lot of boat that lob you who live in a South Bay know about and remember seeing gray whales but yeah growing up as a kid we had you know the ocean just right there as your backyard so you get to know all the animals pretty well dolphins would swim by sea lions harbor seals we'd fish off the pier and also you know we had marine land in the area too and the Cabrillo Aquarium was a resource that a lot of kids have learned about marine life down in Southern California so always exposed to it I always had whales literally just right out my front door yeah same with me I'm from Southern California as well and I would like to say that the gray whale was my first whale that I saw but I can't be sure I know because I usually didn't go well watching during the school year so which is during the winter time you know so but maybe during like spring break I might have so on but for sure I remember seeing blue whales sounds gonna crazy like that's like my I remember being on the fishing grounds about by the oil rigs you're sitting and just a blue whale passing by the boat and I took a picture with like a point June this I didn't I wasn't even into photography I just brought a camera to take pictures efficient stuff at the time but that's something I remember and then I remember this CA fifty ones going across the Bell buoy which is a pretty like crazy memory nice yeah it's pretty amazing that simple things like that just like one little thing like the blue whale passing by or an orca passing by hooked for life yeah actually those aren't the ones that hooked me that I forgot what I was actually hooked me was the minke whale breaching oh I think it was the reaction people got because I told you about it having its mouth open and you can see baleen and the reaction that people got online from that I was just like wow what if I could capture something that people haven't seen before yeah so like I think that also got me pretty addicted into the photography side of it as well I think I annoyed Jim a little bit he laughs a lot when I tell this story but when I took I took a pass no pass like weekend class at the beach about marine mammals I was like how hard could it be let's try it and I kept asking like all these questions and dr. Suh much kept being like no Caitlin science does not know the answer to your question and I was like well why and so like that part was frustrating but also really fascinating and so I was like that's it we're studying whales this is what we're doing here what was your question I think I had like six different thought I was gonna say I remember like after about the third or fourth time he's like Caitlin seriously we don't know the answer I can't remember what I was asking him but it was like between two days it was six different questions then I love know yeah I love Jim's explanation to you especially you know someone as world-renowned as him yeah that's what I love about science and probably why I'm so bad and hate math math there's always like a definite answer where science there really isn't you know sometimes a straight answer for a lot of things we know that's why it drives me nuts when especially on Facebook you someone says something you know and someone you know has they know you are completely wrong it's like in France yeah you might be completely wrong but you never know you might not be completely wrong you know just like perfect example is breaching you know we have so many explanations about that people tell me that I'm wrong when I say yeah and there will be people who tell you no you're wrong about that it's like how do you know you know yeah exactly that's another thing okay people sitting in the armchair you know and a landlocked put Sun no that's absolutely wrong you know so the breaching is a perfect example can't stand be well no you are wrong people choose what their favorite is when it comes to that kind of thing they're like it is for communication it is for fun it's whatever you makes you feel happy it's kind of what you want to go for what people go for it look one of my favorite phrases to say to people about whales it's just when you think you got him figured out they show you you're wrong exactly the blue blue whale breaching thing the same day that that grey whale you know reached in front of I said you know someone else be these guys breach I'm like not that much and lo and behold that guy make sure the whale flukes and I'm like okay was one grey whale he does it big watch I'm like he's down for a while I step into the wheelhouse walk away Eric's still watching we're here everybody scream and I turn and I still saw the whale breach but I didn't even get it turn my camera around I never know I mean uh yeah and I think all three of us here can tell you you know people would say blue whales don't breach I've seen it twice you know they whales don't breach I've seen it well it's yeah I've seen that move I have seen that multiple times in do not look except for that you still I see except but I don't know what you know how they just kind of like wiggle like I don't know how to explain it but if blue could come out when he when he just took off Luke yeah don't tell certain Californians yes fin whales don't cook yeah fluky flukes and what's funny is in fact it was Elise's birthday we all went out on the Long Beach boats and not only we see fluky fluke I kid you not like two other individuals fluke to that day is pretty amazing you know it got to the point where when it first happened people were like oh that's really weird it must be this is the thing I hate the most when people can't explain things oh yeah you know that's a whole nother thing about whales dolphins is the hybridization conversation that's just like a whole nother thing that goes off the rails real fast yeah there are some that are very obvious but there's some you know no we're just going for it I thought you were going off questions off of from our Instagram followers let me see let me see let me see yeah we did get another question do different pods of humpbacks communicate differently that was from Kirstie be underscore seven and yes they do mm-hmm depending on I mean obviously huge population of them has it probably a different dialect yeah so the the most obvious way that we know that is on the breeding grounds with their song so the males as far as we know mostly the male's sing on the breeding grounds the purpose is not entirely known we think probably to attract females or maybe males to compete with for access to females but the song changes over time and you can see the song change across regions too especially in the Pacific you can see the song shift from west to east yeah there is some small talk that bate since the whale vocalizations go so far that other males might be picking up on bits of that song and kind of adding it onto that there so that might be how that this is being kind of changed every few seasons how do you feel about like their being well say let's say the Hawaiian population or Alaska Hawaii and comes over here and then goes up right if they meet I'm sure they run another extra my god the ones from down in Mexico for sure so you don't think maybe they're like there could also be males switching breeding grounds and then if one of them shows up singing a different song the rest of them are like whoo he sounds unique we all need to sound like him we're gonna match his you know it would be cool to find out if they have an idea of someone in Alaska or someone in and then he goes a Y or she and then Alaska and then ends up going to Mexico one year or the opposite there's two different breeding grounds there is one it's unhappy well I don't know too much about it but I know that they I think last year they or the year before they figured that out and that's the cool thing that's gonna hopefully come out of this happy whale project and an easy way to look at is you can kind of think of our black populations not as populations as more as like culture so I think you know just them listening to each other out there and you know those calls from different populations across so they're probably picking them up you know from each other in fact you know their calls can be so unique and you are know are blue whales I think Cascadia has actually determined the populations by you know slight differences in the male's calls and stuff like that I think we've determined that there's 11 populations of Blues out there yeah these calls are really really important yeah they're quite different even with Wow pretty much all the whales out there sperm whales have different dialects between different populations very obvious one but different subpopulations and breeding groups of dolphins and a lot of different species have unique calls okay speaking of unique calls that video that just surfaced of the killer whales the southern resident orcas swimming with the Pacific white-sided dolphins those dolphins obviously can tell the difference between the transient calls and oh yeah they can one call you stay away from trans obviously no because some people I've talked to up there they say that they won't even come within like 50 miles of yeah yeah they're like ships in the night sometimes they just go right by each other don't interact at all they also done tests on California sea lions like they'll play them resident calls and then they'll play them transient calls this is for captive sea lions is where they first figured this out and the transient calls will freak the sea lions out like they just panic I'm sure it's illegal but I think where they did try this I don't know if you guys heard about this in Astoria Oregon one year they had so many sea lions on the docks they did not know what to do the sea lions were damaging the docks damaging the boats so the good fake killer whale that they were gonna drag behind a boat that was also gonna plate really a killer whale songs sea lions they didn't did it but it started to take on water the killer whale part did and so it was gonna like that to cut their losses because it was gonna sink the boat if it took on more water so I think it only worked for like sea lions are no dummy soon no eventually you learn like this thing's not moving I'm gonna sit on top of it yeah you know what's funny is there's a boat X let me go back to boss lighting uh hopefully it's still there there's some guy with one of those inflatable pool toys that looks like an orca that's on his swim stuff it's not working a new port they have have you ever heard of they seen the Google boat did you ever see that actually drop to submarine it's a big catamaran no huge you take a huge cat have coyotes on that they have like you know what are those called stuff coyotes or fake IDs I mean I think it's to scare up the birds to you but it's kind of funny yeah a lot of those things deterrence I kind of laugh at cuz animals get so used to Oh high spirits had a you know had a stuffed cat that was on top of the boat to kind of scare off the gulls when they they pulled up there is a goal right next to the cat like there are friends you know these animals just catch on eventually it looks like us we tried to put that fake out I think it worked for about four hours yeah then Ogawa right next to it become its friends and I would never play the transient call he would he would not because he knows it's wrong it's really interesting like to think that you could I mean just like people like you know do bird calls or like a rabbit calls and stuff like that for when they're hunting exactly yeah man some some of those animals we pretty much feed them you know the bird trip something sometimes yes that one one company does have a permit to Chum to entice birds to come closer to the boat so you can see them better but in the confines of the sanctuary you actually have to have a chumming permit now actually oddly enough because you could be seen as chumming for white sharks that's the actual thing they would ding you on its yeah this interesting how it all shakes out you guys used to Chum for birds yeah in the Monterey Bay yeah I mean some places just still jumped with popcorn from their guests alright I think I got a good topic go for it do it what have you guys seen that I haven't seen Baird's beaked whales okay Cuvier speak to whales all right well you know both both times I either was like moving destination it's over one week I was like two days out for one of them the last one they had I was moving back like to move okay I know one thing you guys have seen that I haven't seen what love the back sea turtle and I'm not nothing about it mmm in fact I've seen two in one day well what about you were intending off morning with false killer was came yeah we have false kill it happened like a couple times they came back up to member nose wasn't our friend Scotty schmidt just talking about how he had like all those dates that he's seen falsies yeah he might have today he was keeping in fact he is the inspiration to my my sightings log before before I wasn't I didn't have to officially keep that how I just write it on the aquarium's blog but yeah yeah he just pointed he reposted his old post February 2nd 3rd 4th 16 18 20 first and then a whole bunch of dates of March and a few in April for what is that false killer whales out of San Diego yeah I just remember them going up the coast and then they came down the coast and I think didn't those Marina del Rey or even that I got one yeah much of those boats all these different I mean I've seen I've seen atps once I also oh you've seen the seal that I haven't seen great seal yeah yeah true yeah we've seen manatees oh I know the counter turtle okay you know what I thought I was gonna win this when I went it I thought I said well okay I'll give me another one that you've seen that I haven't seen Brutus well oh yeah but I don't know technically I've seen that say well but I don't I mean well he was here okay we did have one that was here 2016 season no we had a say well wander around JJ actually saw it a couple times we're gonna said they're both and then we saw something could have been to say well but we didn't really get a close look at it one day you know it's funny as I remember being back at the aquarium there was a picture going around of you know one of those whales that couldn't be ID'd then everyone was was you know tossed it was you know toss to know young fin well grew this was a well yeah then we showed it to like a person who worked on the well Expo East Coast like I'll have to say well like Danny it seems like if you see him all the time you just notice those little tiny little features that will confirm it for you I was like oh wow thanks [Music] if you can't see them yeah they can be the best or they can be the absolute worst the last I think they bow rode for a second encounters at the beginning of the summer this last year if you guys are wondering why dollars porpoise serve no III don't want to say hard to find but hard to see they're just that they are one of the quickest to tations out there hitting 40 miles per hour and sometimes when you do have a sighting of them you will literally not see body all you see is what we call a rooster tail just that their dorsal fin slicing through the water and then it's that's they are lightning fast a little black and white guys and thank you your field guys will probably tell you what they're about five feet max but I don't think I've seen any that big about three foot range guadeloupe possible I've seen both that's what I don't know if I've seen they go out of loop yeah you got look at the face think what a loop in or go out a loop look at the face and what a loop a its fur the fur along the flipper is also different with each animal yeah their face the northern fur seal is like more pointy more like what do they say more like Lassie and then the Guadalupe is a little bit more snug more like I know that the northern first you know the one I saw it was cool because he yawned and like you can see his teeth oh yeah I remember that yeah like it when they're cleaning themselves they like to groom a lot and they rub their flippers all over their body and roll around it's pretty cute I say he yawns but he might have just been like I instead of like smacks or something I was cool okay so go out a loop a fur seal yeah maybe you've seen it maybe you have it I have for sure Golden Gate Station research there's your poster there no actually I don't like the care center I seen rescue toys you know something is really cool with that I feel like is I guess everybody likes it is this sunfish yep oh yeah I like seeing that I've seen Western gulls surf mola mola yeah boy yeah you'll be surprised just be a choppy day where one's riding on top of one yeah and the reason why these birds are landing on the mullah mola or the aka the sunfish is because the sunfish come up to the surface to send themselves and get warm and also because they have parasites on other bodies oh is it just to get the parasite done yeah actually they got really really if you've been lucky enough to touch a ocean sunfish yeah they have really tough skin in my opinion that's rougher than the shark's skin and yeah so obviously when you're out there in the open ocean you got nothing to you got no scratching post you got nobody who can you know scratch an itch for you so ocean sunfish that's how they get their name they actually will lay flat on the surface of the ocean that's a signal for small fish and birds to pull parasites off especially out here in Southern California not well I should say I keep on California where I live here in California coasts where you have like kelp often you get kelp patties you know floating offshore and that will sometimes be a nursery or or a little mini home mini home for some small fish in yeah the mole is actually know that go up next to those sometimes and you know lay flat and those fish will do a little cleaning job for them is it also because of the heating up though as well I've heard that many different times in places - yeah they're down where it's cold you know feeding on jellyfish yeah the jellies the tunicates the salads all those softgel out this animal they eat you know sometimes you know will be abundant down in deeper colder water so yeah they'll want themselves up and an interesting thing about the ocean sunfish I know here we say mola mola but I'm gonna bring up more fish talk just well not that recent well year or two ago we've realized that there's actually three species in the genus mola you got mola mola you got mola Tech tanika mola la alexandrina or something something really Italian sounding of forgotten now normal yeah there's a yeah so we've learned that there's a you know multiple species out there some are bigger than others and also that genus I think it's actually a little bit more than the Pacific the OPA is not related to it yeah yeah they actually are touched and there are closer like to touch it I forgot to sound say tetra Donna forms yeah so they're related to yeah puffers distant relatives of puffers and boxfish and stuff like that but people eat them so they don't have that toxin their bad luck that some other class of animals but they are they do have a whole bunch of different types of parasites so if you are gonna eat it you know there's that whole aspect of it you don't want to kill a sunfish different we can put I know yeah a lot of a lot of us fishermen know that story that miss about them being bad luck but we could probably do a whole episode on uh on these molars they are pretty fascinating if you don't know they are the heaviest bony fish out there historically ones that have been waiting five thousand pounds have been have been seen some weighing a ton are actually kind of kind of common and they're pretty quick growing to I heard from the Monterey Bay Aquarium that in 15 months one gained eight hundred pounds you heard me right fifteen months again 800 pounds that are really quick really I mean like six thousand times their original a like full-body form once they hatch from the egg and become a little sunfish and then they're an adult it's like six thousand times the size Eric and I saw baby mamas in the harbor yeah remember that yeah there's a whole bunch of them in there I mean it's you and I walking over by the harbour office yeah the harbour office they that was the year that they there's like jellies in there too so I think that might have encouraged to the goat go inside the harbour what's funny is about these young ones they always school up sometimes so yeah there's a couple of them I going along that's like a new shallow right there there okay what about rare birds maybe that'll get ya a nice basket nazca booby red footed booby Brown booby yep ladies on our try just those the Nazca I think there's some rarest ones I really got all the way out to Catalina had zero memory cards are at like bigger SD cards pull out a micro SD card I was given a micro SD card I put that in a little reader right then I shoot a picture of this Laysan albatross perfectly flop flying off the water like it's like the cool picture I could have gone to release on I'm Josh I dropped the little micro SD card and lost down the boat weight you see one here though no what I've seen the black-footed albatross here you've seen these on here yeah they'd come here I haven't seen one person yeah one day I saw three at the same time puffins seen it seen them yeah tufted puffins what about some of the rarer shearwaters like short-tailed shearwaters yeah I part seen all those because you guys are just shouting weird names out there's so many different ones out here compared to Southern California yeah well you know I'm surprised we're not getting them now I know when I first moved here we had those petrels their fur drops or get blown in by these guys the fork-tailed yeah we had four tails red and redneck foul ropes and the forked it worked oh wow shooting those birds with flash at night in the harbor harbor that was crazy yeah that was pretty awesome man that's how you know it was windy when you have birds like that in the harbor for several days has anyone double-checked I know if all the wind we had when those showed up it was west winds so this has been like wind from every direction oh yeah that's true every compass direction it's been raining and it's been windy I was collecting hail this morning anything frozen just gives you like gathering scooping it off my like balcony into my hand I haven't brought it in all right can I think about a weirdness that we've seen on the boats we've all seen sperm whales what about striped dolphin have you ever confirmed not alive I personally seen to Shep dad back in Southern California one just washed up last week in San Francisco alive yeah I don't think it made it yeah that's not what yeah it's good what do you guys get these things at like oh I don't ever get I thought I followed like every whale page on the Instagram I guess I don't Facebook oh yeah that's right I'm not that I am on Facebook but Eric and I also get email updates from this listserv called Marmon which is managed by the Society for marine mammalogy right it's actually you thought University Victoria oh you guys forward that to me or just so I can subscribe or just subscribe me if you guys get it Marvin doesn't necessarily put out like stranding notices but it'll put out like new papers internships things like that so if you're interested in reading marine science and you want to get more into whales stuff definitely subscribing to that listserv they put job announcements and volunteer opportunities on there just yeah it's one of those things I always recommend that younger folks trying to get into this field you know get on tomorrow man joined that email list and like Caitlyn just said yeah those volunteer opportunities internships will be a big step in getting your foot in the door but most of our immediate whale nudes where we're like we said the striped dolphin thing is on Facebook which is it's interesting how yeah yeah yeah she'll find is great even just paying attention to win the news companies are posting stuff if like SF Gates posted a dolphin video I'm like oh yeah I'm gonna look at that have you guys seen the spinner dolphin yes I didn't see him spinning I've never seen him I remember the Dolphins up here around the corner you know and and right away they were just shown spinning yeah it was cool it was really overcast I didn't get like the craziest shot we actually didn't spend more than like five minutes with him I think we're on our way back I was like a snorkel trip so yeah it wasn't a whale watch I have not seen offshore bottlenose dolphins we've seen so many later they're the best I was gonna say well I mean they're technically like inshore and offshore yeah but they're different knowing they are they look totally different yeah they act different to you tell the people of difference people well ok wait we did this in the last one yeah ok about the common dolphin thing too as well yeah the inshore offshore the body size difference I think we covered that the officer are a lot bigger than the shore and the behavior is different we saw like three bottlenose fairly offshore on the ACS fundraiser trip in November but I don't know if anybody was actually might just cross tack in here everyone so on yeah I think yeah but there was like three of them they didn't do anything cool so I don't know what's anything on the boat they didn't call it out they like did but I don't remember if they said inch or offshore because someone also misidentified the common dolphins for a while there too so I was like mmm okay what did they call them well they were short beaks and they kept saying they were long beak and I kept looking at I'm going I don't think these are longer were they ever guys close to the harbor no you guys are in close they probably work no they definitely heartbeat they were they were pudgy little guys do you guys want to get good at photographing whales shoot dolphins in Newport Beach for like a week our month straight yeah it's good practice are you kidding if you're going to get those timed and understand their behavior then the whales will be a breeze the best is when the waters clear to you can track them to like two little cakes with their tail and they'll shoot out we're all looking up at a chart lot of things we haven't seen all three of us for sure but is there anything that someone has seen that the rest of us have not like a couple days later they saw in Iceland right after that they saw a white beach dolphin yes yeah that's what they do see those yes I missed the Atlantic white-sided dolphins by one day last time I was on I didn't do everything yeah till like a week ago hopefully I get to see him this year cuz I know that you know the dusky dolphin they look similar to well they're all like a rink yes aren't they yeah whether if they're not leg or incus they're the other one in the list those so the northern right whale dolphin is there those are interesting the list so families are just - I think they're the only lizard elfis yeah the northern and southern alright learning things yes I still need to see your right will yes yeah we said that yeah that's something we definitely need what about a walrus I haven't seen one shot picture one I want to see a long and polar bears did we talked about what's on our whale bucket list no right wells are definitely in all of ours I enjoy with the orcas in Norway mmm that's on my list belugas and our walls you can swim with belugas in the st. Lawrence you can in Churchill yeah [Music] with swimming when our walls be dangerous I want to see the narwhals but I want to swim with the village highway [Laughter] I don't know I'm scared I'm kind of honestly scared some with killer whales and humpbacks too but you know we'll see they are big yeah I've seen them in small boats there they're pretty flippin big yeah like on the Davis I'll never forget that the day a mr. Rainey I mean the fluke was like way out on one side and his head it was up on the other mm-hmm exhaling in people's faces I want to see a group of sperm whales up close I've seen them from a distance but like a nursery group like moms and juveniles I've not had a good encounter with yeah that'd be cool to see yeah way that happens again I saw like but I've never seen a big male like just chillin that's something we talked about how the dwarfism so the male sperm whale is a lot bigger than the female the males can be like 60 feet whereas the females are like yeah for maybe 40 feet so Adonis eats all to swales the male is bigger and then mysticetes the baleen whales the female is bigger I think a firm that yeah it wasn't there's some weirdness with the was it the Bears that the female might be bigger really yeah but I looked it up later put there somewhere talk about that hey just what do you think you have Wales figured out they prove science yeah exactly yeah 6000 pounds already [Laughter] 40-ish feet oh yeah I tell people humpback whale caps are like the same size as my Toyota Tacoma extra cab or standard extended cab okay short bad or long bad short bed so many options and then they weigh about the same too because I actually oddly enough had to have my truck waiting for something one time and it was about 2,000 pounds and humpback whale calves are typically between 1,500 to 2,000 pounds up to a hundred pounds every day yeah whales up yeah when a blue whale yeah when I when a blue whale yeah its younger stage it's eight to nine pounds and ours I'm not sure how long it is that's a good question but yeah infant stage it is closed today yeah I think when they're nursing so the way that I've heard some people explain it is like when they're nursing they're going through this rapid growth right they're gaining a ton of weight not literally ton they're gaining hundreds of pounds of weight every few days and then they sometimes have been recorded to double their body length before they're weaned and then once they're weaned they're kind of set up to last and not feed very well for the next two to three years so until they're figuring it out they could live off of that fat layer that mom is stocked up for them while nursing that's something cool about being in the feeding grounds yes and the humpback population is that we get to see the calves come here on their first year and not feed or try to feed yeah and it's funny cuz you'll see like two or three or six full-grown humpbacks come out of the water with their mouths open and lunch feed on anchovies and in the CAF on the far end just too late I remember my first month here I was actually watching that yeah mom and calf lunch meeting in the CAF would come up late and it didn't forget to close its mouth it just like kept its mouth loved them for extra few seconds probably anchovies are swimming out that was kind of funny it'd make a great photo op but yeah I was like hey buddy you don't want more cat breaches this summer yeah yeah they were good this year I got hardly any full-grown backs breaching they breach but like you know I mean like shots out yeah the calves were really photogenic this year I think one of the funniest ones of the mom and calf trying to feed is the mom and calf were being kind of funny the calf was being a little rambunctious switching sides on mom and rolling around we're all with this high school group and the mom all of a sudden just decides to do this big lunge feed next to the boat and then the calf just breaches right next to her know if you like miss the signal or it was just like I can contribute to this - I mean Slater had a lot of pods where there would be like literally a good dozen wells lunch meeting together and then like a hundred yards away there's a calf like tail throwing non-stop because and then they would stop feeding all the whales and then they would spray COFF and then that mom would join back up with their calf and they would cruise off and then the cap would probably you know continue breaching yeah I've seen that several seasons now and I almost think that's like a temper tantrum like mom I'm hungry and I'm not getting any food while the rest of you are eating and then the calf starts freaking out and the group breaks up there's so much fish around here yeah I've seen and I've also seen where the group stays together and who I presume is the mom peels off quiets down the calf for five to ten minutes and then goes back to the group I've seen that before too so that's where I got the temper tantrum theory from lots of cool behaviors yeah and things you see yes mom and calf pairs especially are super fun I honestly don't know what topic well we're talking about things we haven't seen yeah that may be though it's not piece of it they're big you saw a piece of one yeah oh yeah I've not seen any what you say I saw if I saw it off like you know oh it's either scalp to smooth yeah could be either one though man what about Peter story about a hammerhead we've got the Bob up here in this lady over the rail and she likes this shark [Laughter] didn't land on the show pretty sure the same thing happened again with a cellphone and then the lady dropped the second thing in the water as well like my dad okay so it's funny because I always write for the Balboa pier what about basking shark that's having seen I've never seen one oh no they've been sighted in Monterey since I've lived here but only a handful of times and I've never seen one had one what in China Island this is like a long beach like they used to see him in Monterey all the time until about seven or eight years ago yeah until they accidentally killed all those ones in Big Sur years ago yeah it did make the news I never saw like photos that corroborated 50 sharks but I hear that many corroborated I'm in the description we have put a little like links I mean I know what it means obviously dimorphism yes well other sharks well we have the great whites that we see here juvenile great whites especially yeah I've seen adults here too you want to go on a short trip yeah let's go it's ditching wait can you see the little shark system here no not right now usually yeah wait till it warms never been like have to be at the dock maybe decide to go to Capitola which is about an hour an hour two and a half hour trip become four hours all right sorry guys anyways they're in sighs you're like wood you can say is it a population of like little I guess you can say in nursing ground so yeah over the years we've learned that in the northern part of Bay around the optos even towards the Capitola area close to the shoreline there is young sharks that are there during the warmer months and young juvenile white sharks being six seven feet ish long some slightly bigger ones I've been seeing over there that area has been pretty consistent for sightings during those warmer months to the point where well watching boats have taken special trips over there those in the Santa Cruz area social trips really really special mom trips the boats out of santa cruz obviously have a shorter trip so they've been venturing out there and i know one day it's uh it's hard to say it's your percentage of seeing them are really high one day we went to go find one wind up seeing a dozen or so so that's been a hot pick out here the Monterey Bay is young white sharks do is it true that these white sharks slowly continue going up the coast like as I get when they become an adult like they keep going into colder waters they go where the food is which happens to be central California's a big place for that they have seen them in Oregon and they have had a tagged white shark ping at Port Orford on the new marine protected area up there they got a weird ping on the acoustic sensors in the marine protected area up there a couple years ago they're like what the heck is this and I think it was one of Barbara's sharks for popkins anything as far as I go Laska maybe not that far salmon sharks go that far though right yeah salmon sharks they come down here right but yeah our white sharks these young ones will pretty much stay along the surf and they're just focused on eating rockfish you know perched and stuff in the surf line and then when they get bigger and they'll kind of go to areas where there's bigger food and we always know that they love the elephant seals in this area are true seal seals we are an area known as the red triangle if you draw a line from from a point sir to Bodega Bay and then out to the Farallon Islands it creates this big red triangle we call it and it's a hot spot for a big of white sharks often a fair lines you know you can see them right here just along our coast you talk to local fishermen spear fishermen divers you know they'll report sightings all the time I personally finally saw you know a big white shark I kid you not probably 15 feet Plus kill something off of ano nuevo about two months ago so they're out here when they get bigger and a big you know their teeth actually change so they can support these bigger diets when they're young the teeth aren't that wide and serrated yet when they get hit that 11 plus foot mark as when those teeth get a little bit bigger a little bit wider more serrations so they can handle those bigger meals that they're known for such as the sea lions elephant seals and harbor seals out here and also a lot of talk has been you guys just talked about where they go when they grow up we do know that they some of them possibly are going out to area known as the white shark cafe literally between here and Hawaii was once thought that you know why did I going out there there's not much food there but a team from a Monterey Bay Aquarium has figured out that there is some food out there there are some clues that may be there they're breeding out there so there are one animal that science is you know we see him but we're still trying to figure out exactly what's going on when I'm out here but out here I think we've all seen been lucky enough to see white sharks Makos blues threshers salmon sharks yeah salmon sharks out here probably sevengill shark Caitlin song yeah being consumed and Caitlin you were just talking about the basking sharks that yeah go it up here yeah well I guess I think there was a lab at Moss Landing marine labs that used to consistently study them which to me I think is not too big of a leap to think they used to be here a lot and I've heard stories of old fishermen that used to use gill nets and they would catch basking sharks in the 20s 30s and 40s so they definitely used to be around more I don't really know what happened but there's only been a few sightings since I moved here five years ago yeah it's funny with all the good upwelling we get here in the Monterey Bay Area you know the daughter canyons out here was surprised we don't get them more hunted maybe but I also think there's some kind of shift going on in the California Current and fortunately science funding is low and we're missing whatever's happening cuz like think about albacore used to catch them in Monterey every summer they used to always plan albacore trips and now they catch them off of Oregon and Washington yeah something's going on don't really understand what it is things are shifting and we're kind of losing our chance to document at all used to catch a lot of San Bassam barracuda down south to they always like just kind of say like oh well ever since the squid came through the a time ah yeah it's like well with the albacore I don't think they've necessarily been all fished out or all eaten by something else cuz they're catching them just further north so maybe the basking sharks are hanging out off of Mendocino County and we don't even know it what so we really the jury's out on a lot of things but the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Hopkins marine station are doing some really cool collaborative work on the white shark situation especially with the young ones and I did sit down with Sal Jorgensen last summer and interview him for another project I'm working on and he's got some papers that should be coming out soon so we should know more and have some more definitive answers about what's going on but sounds like those juvenile white sharks are there to stay that's gonna be a reoccurring theme I think for the future so I think we made it sound like we see sharks kind of often I don't know if we made it seem like that but for you people listening we don't see sharks that much and people always say like are we gonna see sharks I'm gonna go whale watching like because they might be scared of sharks or something we see them like one every like a couple hundred trips maybe I don't see them there's a warmer months cesium Morrissey there's a lot of blue sharks yeah so depends on the sea conditions and where you are like the blue sharks if you're out over the canyon and it's calm your odds are pretty good that you could find one but when you have that glassy sea conditions and you're in the right area those things don't line up that often yeah I mean we're also not looking for either you know but when you see them you see them so yeah yeah we're pretty lucky to have them I think a lot of it has to do with you know like I said the sea conditions and I think they might be I don't know it seems like some species fish the white sharks are just popping up a little bit better now I think since the gill nets yeah I don't know you guys are all enough to remember you know having them kind of less of them off of our coastline I should say instead of eliminating trees with less ISM that's what a lot of people think has led to the comeback with his white sharks and wider a little bit more more visible now too not just this situation that's going on in the Ord Monterey Bay but even back down homes later right you know Manhattan Beach start seeing a lot and also and everyone you know half of the into Long Beach Seal Beach oh yeah Huntington Beach San Onofre you know yeah everyone I spent a whole day flying my drone back and forth at near Sunset Beach looking for white sharks mall yeah yeah and even yeah even before I left yeah the warp started doing the shark search trips and we were really six the first year I did it the second year oh man you know cuz ii many also had a had a lot of good sightings don't want to say i don't want to say there you know they just there's more than that popped up there I mean but I think people just start paying attention more and sharks don't you know come to the surface for a breath of air so that's another reason why we don't see them that much mostly it just happened to be basking at the surface resting when we drove by and we saw it and slowed down before we spooked it and then you could see it a lot of people using stand-up paddleboards now - and then obviously drones so we're all we're kind of getting a different perspective nowadays - that's true yeah we're and we're starting to see them show up more on social media because it's a shark so people always you know well everybody's got a camera in their pocket now cuz it's on their phone yeah it's just like people's the gray whales have been going to the beach for ever and for years everybody has a drone yeah and now it's like I mean I have so many photos that people swimming at the beach with gray whales and you know right on the foreground and yeah and same thing with the white sharks I remember you know in high school mid nineties surfing and said no fray the young white shirts were there to the point where some of the locals actually named them yeah and they were like cute names like fluffy and stuff like that so some of you some of you South County guys remember that you know but then you know media and phones and drones caught on and stand-up paddleboards and everyone they hate I had I could see them a little bit easier so technology does kind of spread the word that animals are around all right well that's a pretty good episode I think yeah keep sending us more things to talk about yes but we want to hear what you want to know about yes send them in its kind of night nice just answering questions because then it gets us thinking and that's going on little rants about things that we've seen you know I don't know we can rant about the ocean for a while so give us some give us some direction we'll go for it you guys so much for listening hope you guys enjoyed episode 6 if you guys aren't following us on Instagram it's wale nerds make sure you do that if you guys want to leave us any comments or questions for future topics we be greatly appreciative of that look at you with your big words appreciative and yeah thank you thank you all right thanks everyone thanks for listening

-
hello everyone and welcome back to the well nerds podcast my name is Slater I forgot to introduce myself last week it's okay we knew you're here and I'm here with Eric and Katelyn hey everyone and this is episode 7 in whoo can't believe we're are down 7 yeah I know it feels like we started just last week and I don't think we have a topic yet but we're gonna let these we got some questions from Instagram so I think we're gonna start with some questions off the Instagram and then we will just see where those take us yeah go for it question number one how long do humpback whales live hmm good question we actually briefly touched on that one on one of our previous episodes about the aging of whales and most baleen whales out there that we have out here at Monterey Bay were estimating that some of them are probably a little bit longer than the human lifespan maybe about 80 years or so but we do know some of our bowhead whales in the arctic are living a 150 years plus so there's a lot of ways out there that they're trying to determine the exact ages of these animals so it's still kind of a hot topic out there good well research believe it or not really hasn't started since the early 70s because in the 70s pre seventies lava when we saw well we didn't go oh man you know these things are wonderful we need to save them we were looking at a whale and going hey man that's like that's like a hundred barrels of whale oil there that's gonna cut that's gonna be a lot of money in my pocket so some of the whales that we're keeping track of are currently still alive and I do know a lot of you obviously you're listening because you're fans of marine wildlife but some of you might recall the granny story there are some extreme accounts that she was a probably a hundred plus years old and there are some more conservative figures that she was a lot younger than that so that's still kind of a hot debate too you saw Connie I saw granny yeah I did fortunately you guys are jumping on the bandwagon of the was she gone unfortunately yeah well you know what what what's the happy what's happy what's a happy as well now what's that oldest whale on happy whale that's a good question I'll try to hook it up maybe when Ted comes back you know you might be able to let us know I know Cascadia has photos from the early 80s for sure like pre splash I think even beyond that yeah yeah because what we what we tell people sometimes up after I've been talking to Ted and John Callen Makita says you know some of these whales already looked like old whales in the 81 to 85 catalog so how old are they really cuz they're still alive yeah so ages could definitely vary by species I do know there was a one bottlenose that recently passed that was I think close to the 60 year old mark all right so I found it and the longest intervals between sightings is 40 years 3 months and 3 days is that son happy way is that the Alaska one let me look that is no Newfoundland in Bermuda oh cool yeah and then we learned that right whales from the talk that some even those whales might be pushing close to a hundred yeah somebody I mean some people even speculate blue whales live close to 100 years and then not even not even that far behind this one forty years in one month mm-hmm and now we're two sightings yeah between which that's also impressive is like you think you've lost track of a whale for 10 to 15 years and then all sudden you see it again yeah so overall it does look like our big armistice eats our baleen whales are quite long-lived add on to seats it's probably a close second and then as far as little about the seats we do know our porpoise out there actually have probably the shortest lifespan as smart as cetaceans go yeah something in the range of 15 to 20 years is probably normal for a corpus but they'd be on the shorter end of things yeah so good question still I guess mention the previous episode it's still it's science to figure it out that was one of those questions that I think I asked in my introduction of marine mammals class or I was like dumbfounded that I was like wait why don't we know why don't we know how long they live and this is like Kaitlyn we don't know she's pretty awesome I feel like Nemo's dad right now remember see if you see a sea turtle ask him how old is all right next question do you know any European places to go see orca whales apart from Norway later yeah you traveled I've stuck close to I know that they see them in Iceland I'm pretty sure they see them during the winter time in Iceland yeah but they do see them in the summer but it's not as frequently yeah you can I don't think it's a regular thing but I have heard of sightings a couple times a year off the Canary Islands which is technically off the coast of Africa yeah I was gonna say thinking what is North Sea or something there's a small population but those killer whales are actually really in trouble to the ones they see around like Ireland and Scotland those ones are suffering from a lot of pollutant issues in the water yeah and we might start seeing more whales pop not that they weren't popping up before but because of social media stuff we might start learning more about killer whales being in other places yeah we find out what they are well that move so much - you know our killer whales can easily move 100-plus miles a days yeah huge ranges on these animals all right well we got a question about how are they how are the whales affected by climate change that is an ongoing question that's being investigated there's some some things that happen with climate change also in relation to ocean acidification are gonna have ramifications down the line yeah spider oh yeah krill species have are gonna be affected by the acidity of the ocean because of their ability to make their shells and so if krill stocks than animals that are dependent on krill like blue whales are really gonna have a hard time in slater what's that documentary you're for it's really good but yeah the sea ice isn't there then that's where the krill of rehab you made me watch it it was really good actually saved it yeah so in the Antarctic especially that's where that could become a big problem really fast as a curl down there shelters under the sea ice and is that when they breed yeah they're breeding under the sea I yeah so if there's less habitat then there's less ability for them to breed and the krill are feeding on the sea they're feeding on like a bacteria or some feed off of and in the short term that could mean really good eating for whales because the krill are exposed but in the long term that doesn't lead to a bigger krill population yeah but I also know a lot of scientists have said is the beaked shall inherit the earth in the face of climate change so cephalopods squid species are gonna do well in the face of climate change which means animals that eat those species like beaked whales and Rizzo's dolphins and pilot whales they're gonna survive because they will have prey as long as they can get into a good temperature range that they're gonna be able to tolerate did you find it I seem to have forgot my next fix well we can answer another question Wow your let's see great whales are also going to survive climate change because they're super Hardy alright so the question is most bizarre encounter while out at sea what are you thinking you guys both like turned your head there's a few the weirdest thing I've seen there's two things that I say to people in there like what one I've seen a freezer floating out in the ocean and - I've seen a dead calf let me count lotion but as far as wildlife I think one of the more bizarre things I've seen is these juvenile killer whales put a mola mola like on their forehead on their melon and like balanced it out of the water so their head was out of the water and the mola was on top of their head was it still whole yeah they were like and then later they threw it like a frisbee they like chucked it with their mouth it was really witty they are frisbees not just for kill arrows but for see ya feel bad for them they're like perfect little circles it people just want to skip like a rock yeah see it a lot out there unfortunately some of our divers out here locally will actually find mola mola with no fins just kind of sitting on the bomba seafloor yeah hard life in the Monterey Bay yeah and they are bizarre looking - I mean they're pretty bizarre animal we we encounter them regularly but to most people I mean think of that Boston sunfish video that went viral yeah I know actually when I put them on my story like you know we pulled they're big ones people are like what alien baby whale J flounder J that's a YouTube video that's out that videos on YouTube you guys want to look it up yeah I've had some I mean well you can kind of consider them bizarre yet kind of life-changing - I remember one of my first few whale watching trips I was doing when I was back at the aquarium we were just flying down the coast and we were with some offshore ball nosed dolphins but they just happened to be going where we were going because we got word that there were some gray whales at a certain location so we're heading there and then we eventually got to an area where we started seeing the gray whales and we started slowing down and the offshore bottlenose kind of you know kind of just kind of slowly drifting back but one of them kept on like keeping up at the bow you know as we either came to a stop and this thing actually got its head out of the water turn back and looked at me like I died and started vocalizing like typical like what you would imagine seeing like in a movie or you know in one of your dreams it just looked at me I go like vocalizing like I don't speak dolphin you know I'm short bottlenose dolphin but you kind of got there any comment yeah I speak common yeah a little bit of lag too but uh this dolphin I mean I didn't have to speak ball but you could just tell it was probably telling me hey what are you doing now is having fun get this boat going again I want about right vocalize at me for like nine straight seconds it's like yeah that's amazing but some vocalization in my face as far as bizarre new unique stuff I share all three of us could probably write a book about the collections I summer that was like looked like it was broken in the shallow water that was pretty funny did you see that whale that this summer no I've never had a Gumby because it was like putting its head and tail up at the same time and like maybe shape with his body and then it was like we think it was doing a headstand it was in such shallow water its face had to be in the bottom and it was up like he was doing all kinds of weird now I remember something we remember might one of my first trips here you know working on the boat and we were just chugging along and then we're going quite quite slow then I just happened to be in the back of the boat with Brit know just look off and just right below the surface of the ocean I see something big and white about four feet long float in the water so I'm like what is that actually yell loud enough that you know our captain slowed down and he kind of circled back a little backed up a little so we can take a look at it it was it was actually a huge chunk of it looked like squid it was probably about a good three inches thick and four feet long and I was like this has to be you know either you know giant or costal squid it's a piece of it we gotta get this you know and even though it was below the surface you could smell it you know our titles like you are not bringing that my vote but this is might be important you know this is just a piece of it it's four feet long he's like nope okay what up son fish eating Velella Velella yeah it's so funny cuz some fish have big like they're basically like googly eyes eyes that you glue to a paper and they shake like a mouth and they like go cross-eyed and like go ahead on towards these charter it's hard to explain it's like a little disc that has its own sail and then little blue tentacles hanging down it's funny to watch them slurp them down yeah or miss them and it had the circle go for it the best is when they miss them and you know they like do this pretty quick turn for how awkward their body is they like do a hairpin turn should I go back for it this one day Newport we had like four or five sea lions take down four or five thresher shark in like lesson yeah that's in five minutes I had a Sawyer pics of that yeah like I was filming a whale with my drone and this happened and then I obviously went over and filmed that and I got three or four different ones and I saw fresh kills like we're the one got out of the way I were like it let go of it or didn't mean to let go of it but the shark you know got away and then went back down grabbed it pulled it back up so that was pretty cool that's pretty bizarre thing to watch I mean yeah yeah they could eat that they could do that underwater you know and like watching them with it with that big long tail oh yeah I've seen em I've seen them eat you know you seen any smooth hounds and all and stuff I got four but four or five of them and I could write it in it was just like I saw a sea lion eat a big skate and it was like the wingspan of the skate was almost as long as the sea lion I was like really out here yeah yeah so for those of you maybe I haven't seen a California sea lion to eat something they shake it like a dog they like rip it they thrash it on the water they smack it on the water yeah so it's it's pretty interesting to watch they they're basically just tearing pieces off of it and then swallowing down because they can't swallow the shark oh boy and they don't have you know they can't use their flippers to help like pull it apart in pieces so they just shake it and rip it throw it which is funny as I feel like harvest duties are flippers they do because they have the kool-aid like I mean she lights up closet yeah there's two but the harvest is you can really see them yes there well harbor seal front flippers are not their main like locomotion they don't these are yeah harbor seals use the rear to propel themselves and then see lines use the front flippers to in their high understeer yeah exactly so yeah I don't know I don't have a super bizarre story for the ocean what oh no I saw a pufferfish on to Newport that's cool without your offshore is easy the probably should come from and well yeah the pufferfish actually there's been a lot spotted during the El Ninos in fact there's a few kinds that been showing up I want to say that the sharp nose puffer been showing up in Southern California also there was a report of a porcupine fish off of the Long Beach breakwater and a fisherman actually saw it and caught it and actually took it to the Aquarium of the Pacific and that actually was on display for a little bit up in the displays so yeah yeah yeah they actually brought into the corner in the aquarium actually didn't notice it was kind of a good thing it didn't look too hot and it actually lived up in the upstairs in their Baja California exhibit forgot the exact name of that enclosure but yeah it was there and actually have a few pictures of it so yeah those fish did show up in a few types shut up in California or fishy snake no only when I talk about that stuff anymore but the oarfish yeah was actually found off of the Trump golf course a few years ago and parts of it were recovered I think Cal State Fullerton actually got the stomach contents of it and I just took the head and that was it and then you guys don't know what or fish are their type of fish we actually kind of don't know much about are a fish that is quite long and there actually is one on display at the Natural History Museum that's about 13 to 14 feet long and they're kind of funny they kind of swim like in the vertical position time and they don't have really strong muscles their flesh is really mushy and they kind of swim vertically hoping for like small inverts krill and stuff to kind of swim by and they'll they'll gobble them up and there's been a few spotted and the Philippines Japan in fact in Japan when he starts showing up in good numbers they think it's a sign of something bad about to happen like an omen like earthquakes or something like I think that if you google it there's a picture of one on Catalina right yeah it's like really long that one was found right before I found mine and Brett before I found out there's also a few found in La Jolla at that particular summer there were a lot of them showing up in California waters and this is a pretty rare fish to find alive already and even to find dead obviously so so it's a they're pretty well documented because of the rarity of it when they are seen all right well when I find something bizarre oh let you guys know I'm sure I just can't wait we're gonna end this recording you're be like oh man yeah it's kind of a loaded question cuz like things that are bizarre to most people we don't think are bizarre is the other thing I mean like seeing a leatherback turtle even jellyfish I have a jellyfish ring and I smell it's pretty bizarre yeah it's not bizarre it's just like rare to see yeah so I think there's a lot of rare things like on the when I was working on the fishing boat the rat fishes are pretty cool oh yeah that's a bizarre fish can they're really cool or slime eels are bizarre mm-hmm or I think about encounters when you're with whales and really thick fog it's not necessarily even something you see just the whole everything about the encounter like it the fog is really thick and you're smelling for whales or you're listening for whales you don't actually usually see the whale first you're using your other senses to find them and then especially when you're the naturalist trying to explore the passengers what you're doing and breed reaching blue whales and fin whales is technically kind of bizarre to think people experienced that yeah they're rare occasions all right so that's to another question okay alright I would love to know more about the history of pilot whales on the California coast [Music] very good question okay so it's funny you mention that because myself and Caitlin just happened to come back from the Southern California marine mammal workshop and there actually was talk about this but just to put it in plain you know quick little you know Cliff's Notes form we think it's a little to do of climate change and a little bit to do with and that obviously leads to the shift I shouldn't really say climate change more and shift we have this traditional shift in the currents in our ocean that could happen about every ten years more or less and what happens is that even causes food to shift so that obviously can lead to different animals coming into places so there's a few theories about that but I think Caitlin actually has notes regarding this matter so take it away yeah so Tom Jefferson also collaborated with ELISA Schulman Jagger they did a poster at a conference yeah but Tom presented talking about short-finned pilot whales in Southern California there are sightings going back all the way to the 1920s but from the 1950s to the 1980s they were really common around the around Catalina Island they considered them like residents of Catalina Island and then starting in the mid-1980s there was a big decline they think a lot of it has to do with the 1982 1983 El Nino cuz the squid fishery crashed but there also was increasing fishing pressure out at Catalina for market squids like those purse seining boats and they do use acoustic deterrents for sea lions but those also can affect odontocetes in the area that are very sensitive to sound they're like these little firecrackers that they put in the nets to spook the sea lion out yeah I think we talked about those right yeah so between the disturbance and then the competition for food and then this fishery crashing that may have encouraged them to shift out of the area but they also were heavily targeted for I've captures especially pre-1970s for Marineland so they were caught to be put on display in aquariums yeah some of us room I from Southern California right remember bubbles so yeah so they had a history of removals from habitat that have been recorded from 1952 to 2014 45 were bycatch in different fisheries 108 were strandings 76 were live captured three I think were found dead on the beach with no cause of death and they also Catalina Island is not too far away from where they test naval sonar and that sometimes the locations of that are not always disclosed so you don't know how close to pilot whales may have been especially with that 108 la strandings pilot whales are one of those species that do master and so they'll end up in the beach on the beaches in like the 20s 30s 40s and 50s numbers and so they're kind of more susceptible to things like that Rizzo's dolphins are more common now in Southern California they don't know if like they're filling a niche that was emptied or if there was some kind of like competition between pilot whales or Rizzo's but kind of the long and short of it is that they used to be really abundant and now they're not and tom was kind of like this is really perplexing like this seems to have happened right there our noses and we missed it yeah so a lot of possible factors El Nino being too warm squid usually will shift to the cooler waters and the bycatch issue yeah so there's a lot of that's a really good question so I've always seen thought yeah the short game pilot was started two times in Newport Beach and I'm pretty sure they were a year apart was it posted or they were in the same month a year Wow was it pretty far offshore or close to shore knows we were like sure right off these Newport Coast oh wow right there yeah it was I was on Newport Coastal's bow and then I think dolphins Safari came up to it just to zodiacs out there with that last I saw was yeah it's a tuna fishing it's usually the back side of Catalina are all the way towards that closer toward San Clemente we run into illegal occasions yeah I saw him on a survey ship we are off of Point Conception I think we're over a hundred miles from shore and they just like buzzed across the bow of the boat we got a few photos confirmed the species and the thous it there so neat looking those dorsal fins are just weird like kind of like a I would say kind of like a Pacific white-sided but like more even more really low yeah yeah and thicker yeah yeah so yeah that's a very good question and that's yeah that what Caitlin said are is number of the thoughts out there about why these animals are such a rarity off our coasts even though they're almost like like we said earlier they were like almost residence in the Catalina Island area yeah and it's kind of hard to know what to make of all that whether that means that their population just went through a major decline and that's why we don't see them or did they shift their habitat because of all those things or is it both like there was a decline in the population that changed the cultural structure of those groups that would be around Catalina and so then there was like this fission-fusion thing going on with the pods and then they all just kind of scattered you do see that in other species like wolves when the pack like loses at alpha and then like everything gets the pecking order gets rearranged sometimes the packs completely split into two or three groups and some groups don't make it because the culture got broken and there's no leader anymore so that could be happening with odontocetes too Carl Safina actually talked about that in shoot what's the name of his book beyond words he talked he talked a little bit about that with different types of animals and killer whales is one of them and pilot whales are in that blackfish family with killer whales and have strong cultural ties to which is also why they master and some scientists believe like there could be just one whale SiC and the other whales won't leave it and I'll go to the boat I'll clue the boat yeah the beach together and they all end up dying even though only one of them was sick oh yeah no question a lot of questions are dis repeated like how long do humpback whales live here's its back to the killer well where is the best place to see killer whales in the wild and I think that this is kind of a hard question to answer because you could say that Monterey is the best in April in May or you could say that you know in San Juan Islands is the best during July to October or is good yeah I really I think they're they travel so much that it's really hard to say when the best is yeah I mean they see them really consistently in the wintertime in Norway too and the fjords when they're feeding on the herring so yeah it's kind of hard to say Western Australia they're pretty consistent right now they're saying I mean there's places that you can guarantee see them during like their peak times I would say like it's a peak couple weeks of a year or a month in a year a couple months in a year yeah yeah you can see them but it's not like every single day they just gotta keep on going well yeah hotspots would be like Southeast Alaska San Juan Islands Monterey Western Australia Iceland Norway yeah Sanwa San Juan Islands and then here in Monterey is where I've had the best luck you know I've I think my my logs I checked I think it was four days in a row was my record here and then San Juan I've had you know like transients transients transit days where you know transients and residents you know they have two days since I lived here yeah seasons where we've had like 10 to 14 days in a row I'd have to go look at my notes I felt like me and you yeah that first week I moved here is intense it was like every time if you guys if you want to see other worlds just move to Monterrey and you'll see them for your first week when you move here but then after that they won't come by it's just it's like to get you in yeah my my first day of moving here I remember jumping on I told the high spirits and I had Emma her pod porpoising out of the water I was like that's a nice welcome to Monterey and then you work on the other boat same thing I was like what's going on here when I moved here my like one of my best breeches the one that gets shared the mine that was in the fall yo yeah it was November like November 13 1982 November 3rd deep but a you I you and I and John and Daniel and at least I like you're all looking at this one killer little preacher right at it it was really nice sense and then I'm humpback whale breached oh yeah watching this pot and a humpback whale breached all the way from like the first buoy leaving Harbor all the way out yeah like a round point Pinos it breaches way right through a pot of killer whales like he was just like I'm gonna go through this area but like you can't touch me amazing yeah that's bizarre I mean seriously 40 minutes straight in breaching we're all like oh yeah look at that I remember I was narrating cuz I was like oh yeah there's that humpback over they were still breaching we're like so focused on the killer whales and finally were like god we have to go watch this humpback now because this thing has been preaching for 40 minutes I think what's your record I had a combination of breaching and chin slapping I think it was over 70 times I actually stopped counting after around 70 whoa I think you're on the boat this summer we had a calf I just did it over and over we had so many breaching calves in the past we're just going yeah that's a good year for with active calves this year yes well I think we're honestly out of questions on the Instagram so okay what do you guys want to talk about wait what you see today Eric no today you know what I'm starting to see the northbounders today so I did I did check out the reports from Elise's group down south you know with the their counts and they know this North bother so I was expecting some so yeah low and ball today not some North bounders and some South bounders so we're it's always around mid February you get that time where the whales literally cross the stars pounds like hey have fun in Baja alright see you in Alaska so gray whales yeah we had gray well I'm talking about gray whales we're in mid-february once again there's usually that transition period so you'll start seeing your North bounders and whether else yeah we actually had a mature element I'm sorry not mature at all but a a maturing I should say southern I mean northern elephant seals lost you said Saturn he threw me out so that was an ordered elephant seal inside our harbor and that's quite a rare sighting to have inside our harbor usually you have to head over to I know nuevo or San Simeon to see these animals but we do get you know animals sometimes way off shore but to see one in the harbor you know male with that big old cool nose you know hanging out right under the sea lions what we usually refer to as the Coast Guard pier out here so it was a really cool setting and I did post up some pictures on our companies that they'll put some of my personal okay you guys follow me on Instagram or Facebook and that big old nose is for the mating call really right yeah those those vocalizations make they make her pretty attached that's pretty good I've seen a juvenile harbor seal and a juvenile elephant seal like follow each other around the harbor I was like I got really I got down really early to the boat in the morning and I was like getting ready and then the slip next to us was empty and this like little harbor seal in elephant seal were just like swimming in circles together in the empties yeah and then our buddy Brian had that no footage of that younger elephant seal within our harbor so the young ones yeah it's not too surprising to see him in the harbor but to see a a male and there it was pretty it was pretty cool I feel like there's been more in the harbor the last few years because earlier last summer we had a like a weiner you know the harbor just taking a nap over by the sailboats and I think it's exactly I think the situation is exactly like the humpback situation populations doing well you're making a great comeback your numbers are going up so obviously the animals gonna be more spread out everywhere so and if you guys don't know what a wiener is that's a young see ours all right that's been we it was and it was during the summer so it was molting - so it's like skin was all icky all right I know we can talk about actually you brought it up and I just stole it what a l'heure what is your favorite well movie my favorite well movie is wait let me guess cuz you already told me well right yeah I like well write it the reason why I like well writer is because I actually like how it if you haven't seen it yet well shouldn't even give it away but anyway it's based on a story by the Maori and I just it just kind of shows you how whales have gone so far back and so many different cultures you know you know all the way down the South Pacific and obviously up to work towards you know Alaska and you know Canada you can see how the cetaceans have been a big part of these peoples cultures for you know centuries so I like that factor as far as books go oh man I didn't even say anything about books yeah you did no I took it out you take it back I just said no take-backs I'm gonna talk about books now well no one wants to read this is a podcast listener books well being a big nerd my favorite book is I like ev'ry busted the books I read a more reference books I'm a big nerd that's alright well and science talk yeah but that's what the books called that's all yeah that one's really good and there's only there's this one book on blue whales that was decent I was a while while blue was it the one I recommended yeah I've heard 13 books in my life Eric cuz you listen they were all in the listens to the rest but yeah I have a lot of books it's hard to pick a favorite but those are the ones I actually look at over and over again well my favorite whale movie is flipper nice is that illegal No why would it be illegal because he's a captive dog I mean Eric's closeted a free willy fan that's really should be his number-one one yeah in fact people used to always ask me about like how I got into the field on there always tell him well you know I grew up in the Pacific Northwest it's kind of a bad kid and cuz one day I stole some food out of a catering truck and the cops were looking for me and they found me so I started running away and I hid inside this marine part this sounds like the plot of Free Willy and you know I takes about ten minutes people realize and you know that I'm saying that again yeah wait yeah not usually calls in the the or can we play the harmonica in flipper I like that he uses the torch to make his toast on the wall you know you're talking about I've never seen that version what do you mean that version it's a movie the main one I'm just using is their flipper to be sure there's a TV show yeah I thought it started as a TV show did it start as movie I don't know we need to talk to Ric O'Barry others did he who was what's his name that lives here that films a whales Bob towel towel did he work on that movie or what movie did he work on he actually filmed that the big I thought he filmed the beginning of a pretty Willie that's seen with with granny in the beginning opening credits oh yeah that's j-pod in the beginning of Free Willy you'll see clearly see granny and her little little bite mark in that middle that dorsal salmon might not even a biscuit might not even be a bite mark each other favorite book I don't know you're just probably the same as mine Slater right now spying on whales yeah I told you I've read many books do you want to like but I don't know I mean Nick Pines in he's a really good writer he's and he's he reads the audiobook too and he's a really good like it's really easy to listen to and he's a really good science communicator so I really like that book not only for the like how good he is at his craft and communicating it but also the content yeah goodbye a lot ivana citizen here three times actually fall asleep to it I did last night hitting it I don't know I spent the night with the day at there yeah it's definitely a good book it's one of my favorites right now yeah Jarek is like afraid to pick it up for some reason I read my books in order I had like three or four other who puts a list of books on their walls people with OCD Slater do dis really I mean I do but then sometimes I'm like nah forget it I'm gonna get right in the middle just first off it takes me like at least six like every six years I get a new book reading when I get up it's so hard for me to find it like the book has to be a story ya have a good story yeah sure that guy Nick paintin has another book that I was looking at it's a book by another gem and actually I think he's a german paleontologist yeah the walking whales i like to listen it is nice actually I listen to it while I'm biking to do when I'm popping wheelies on my bike I got to have to flip through pages dude I'm not popping wheelies I'm trying to like get through my cold bike ride in the morning by the time I get there it's a little like less cold yeah well I think that's it for us on our books and movies yes when we get new books definitely you guys know we did that our previous episodes but if there's any good well movies that you guys can recommend and I don't like watching movies like The Cove or I mean we watched blackfish again but those are just so sad you know yeah we also started a resource page on our pod bean site where we've been adding resources that we talked about like books documentaries email listservs websites to check up on social media accounts to follow where we get a lot of information from so if you have something you want us to look into that maybe we don't know and we can add it to the list or if you're looking for what we're looking at when we reference in the podcasts they're starting to be a growing list on the pod being part of our podcast site yeah we'll definitely try to keep that updated yes for sure all right well episode 7 in the books thank you guys for listening you don't follow us on Instagram make sure you follow us it's well nerds and yeah thanks for listening yeah send us some more topics to talk about we're having fun answering your questions alright guys so once again thanks for listening it's been really fun and hopefully you guys give us some more cool topics to talk about so thanks for listening thank you

hello everyone and welcome back to the welders podcast this is episode 8 I'm here with Eric and Kaitlin hey everyone hello my name is Slater and we are talking whales yes we are but first we're talking friendships what yeah we're gonna talk about a little bit about us and then how he got into the field and all kinds of other fun stuff where did I meet you guys have I know where I'm at Katelyn I met her on the back of the circlip er Margot was very very yep yeah what do you me you Harbor Breeze yeah but I feel like I knew who Eric was online for a long time before I knew who and I think I knew both you were online yeah yeah Facebook yeah I knew I knew Slater more photography was for a while yeah well kind of everybody kept telling me like oh you should you should meet this guy Slater more and and then he came up to Monterey when I was on contract with the BBC so I never actually saw him when he came to Monterey there was a cost leaders there and I was like boo Slater who's well nerd and then I was trapped on a boat with him for eight hours me we were already it was 13 yeah it was but we saw lots of cool stuff yeah I got some of my best photos that day yeah isn't that crazy yeah like there's like a select few days that you know like you got your best stuff yeah those are the days you remember rest of your life I think because I think I talked about this another podcast but because I'm photographing you definitely remember it yeah you know I'm sure you guys photographed you when you're out there hmm yeah yeah but it takes a lot for me to take out the camera well back then I was shooting all the time cuz I was asked to as we are the deck crew responsibilities and but yeah that was one of the nicest days flat glassy calm we stayed out till sunset wait killer whales like breaching and tail army in the sense it was so sunburned my wife sushi and like giving up at like our 7:00 and she's laying down on her iPad meanwhile I'm like in the back corner shaking my head like no we are not going both I mean I'm glad obviously that we didn't it my last shot of the night was my killer whale breaching in the sunset yeah so mm-hmm never know if you stay like ten minutes later something crazy could happen yeah but you saw it I think I seen it yeah oh so when you were doing for the giveaway yeah I think I've been really officially well I met Eric bioluminescent kayaking yeah I interacted with him in person and then when we were looking to open discovery I was looking for someone that had like both sides of the business experience as far as managing and then also on the boats and the education and stuff and so I was like oh Eric and then our good friend Kate Cummings just like gave me the nudge I needed to call him and offer him a job and then asked for joint custody of Eric I can't wait for them to get back I'll be back for like another five or six days at least right yeah it's gonna be a while and then we're all going right no but you and I are going on let's say that we have so many things for 2020 like 2020 I'm going to Norway 2020 it's like how many trips we can we do when you last game when we last talked yeah mmm too many trips are but there's so many places I need to go to see whales mmm there's so much that I need to go yeah not that I just want to go I just need to you need to back to this thing yeah what was it I've always wanted this myself - Slater I obviously I've known you for a while as a friend but how the heck did you learn how to take such great photos I didn't write it like that and that's just coming out of my head that was from the heart well when you work on a boat as a deckhand and you know in a place that there's not very many whales time on your hands to look stuff up on Google on YouTube and I shot every day I shot every day for five years now I mean obviously I shot more back when I was in Newport because of whether it was better so I went every day yeah just something helping out on the boat like fish photos no I was originally well you know I was a deckhand on the fishing boat for like seven years and then I moved over to the whale watching boat was a deckhand there right when I got my captain license I moved over there to be a deckhand so that I could eventually run the boat which didn't happen because I was given a camera and I was given a camera by the company so that I could take pictures of people for souvenirs but instead of taking pictures of well I took pictures of the people but I line them up in the corner from the upper deck down to the lower deck so that I could get them with the Dolphins in the wake the common dolphin so I started doing that and then I started taking pictures of the Dolphins to throw it in the mix so they can get like photo of them and the animal and then I just started cutting the people out so that's how it all started just like oh hey there's dolphins back there we got it they bought us a Nikon something something and printer and that printer Jam so many times and I used to put five photos and it's a separate sleeve for each photo and I'd hold all five with him and walk around to every person on the boat and say it's for what was it it was for for $20 no four or five for each single photo or all of them for 20 oh my soul upon the boat yeah single and I printed them oh no way yeah it started with a printer uh-huh I'll tell you how it changed the digital was sperm whales the sperm whales the printer jammed and I was like was that the nursery pod day yeah the fickle so you're still a fish oh you're right so yeah the printer jammed and like I had promises to both photos didn't trip so then I was like you know just give me your email and every single person on the entire Bogatyr there you go I have like 60 emails like in you know there's a hundred so that's a good that's a good amount of emails you know so yeah I remember China and and then I didn't pay for the program so I had to send like five out at a time and keep doing it until I got you Katy well marine biology I didn't decide to do till I was in college I was doing biology I was actually working with mycobacteria phage which are viruses that eat mycobacteria boring yeah that was my end conclusion was like you know the lab was pretty well funded but it was simple boring and the bacterial smell and I was like I can't do this and I ended up taking Jim sue Mitch's class for a weekend I was like how hard can this be pass/no pass whales and dolphins for the weekend in Newport cool and I loved it for Oregon not Newport Oregon this is that where you stay it's cool and then I fell in love with it and then just kind of stuck with it we have we actually at Oregon State have opportunities for undergraduates which actually are getting better and better all the time just you know in case you want to go there someday for your degree and I took two terms back to back out at the coastal campus at Hatfield Marine Science Center and during the summer term I actually worked at my first whale watch gig at marine Discovery Tours on the bay front in Newport it was called marine Discovery yes it was all the way i watch companies that I've worked for half-assed discovery okay so I was working for freedom Dawn and I've worked for two places in Discovery technically Larry Hartman had a discovery I don't know what it's called or just discovery something really that was private but yeah discovery so yeah some MDTA I worked mostly in the office they originally when they hired me said they'd probably be able to put me on but and then that didn't really happen and then summer summertime ended and I was supposed to go back to school anyway which was kind of perfect because in the winter time and on the Oregon coast they basically shut down so there's not that boats not running they're doing maintenance there maybe doing bait oars but the rest of their income comes from the retail store in the hotel they had upstairs above the landing so I was like whatever that's fine it's like not really aligned with what I want to do and I got to go back to the main campus so then I was gonna graduate and I was like well what do i do do I go north to the San Juan Islands do I go south but you know do I go back to Newport and there was an internship posted out a whale watch company in Monterey and I was like well let's try it and so I packed up my life in my truck and my savings account and rented a bedroom in someone's house in Marina California did you know the majority nope I knew no one and I just went for it and it worked out like within two months of having a free volunteer internship I was getting paid like 15 to 20 hours a week and that was enough to keep paying bills and staying there so then I worked my way into a full time job so it's a patient knows volunteer but I kept saying like hey whatever on the boats and so they put me in the shop for a little while then I started to learn more and more about the boat stuff and then I was like mainly the deckhand that did all those extended trips for a long time I learned a lot about you know how to operate the vessel maintenance all that kind of stuff because I wanted that experience to you know I like I wanted to learn how to troubleshoot and how to run the boat and all that kind of stuff also which was good really interesting I know yeah I didn't know you were hired on as an intern that's pretty cool I knew that but I thought I knew you started getting paid right away yeah it was pretty quick after I got down there that I was at least getting part-time pay in the shop hard to live here not get paid yeah I was like almost out of money and then just kidding usually you get really rich when you watch whales the tips were but no not that can it just can be seasonal you know just basically if you work in the oil industry sometimes you got to save your acorns for the winter yeah you got to make hay while the Sun shines and you got this asset away from this winter is a perfect example is this yeah yeah not even once and it hasn't been windy either yeah okay what about you me I'm all to this is giving a long story okay so yeah I grew up in the South Bay and I'm sorry you have to be from central or Northern California I'm talking about South Bay as a Santa Monica Bay so yeah when I moved up here I say people think like San Jose or something you just talk about a 40 so yeah I'm from that part of California yeah grew up in the Torrance Redondo Beach area and it was always by the water and you know my dad was a freshman and diver so loved the ocean that was my backyard and I was obsessed with fish as a kid to the point where I got in trouble because my parents buy my fish and I stick my hand there and pet them and play with them Eric that's a goldfish typos once at any point yeah I remember once my first few fish were from Sears Sears used to sell fish and like yeah they thought they had a pet section and I remember buying fish angelfish you could actually get livestock there years ago you can get chicken everything there everything you could even buy you got that much over there you can also basis of prefab houses - so you're sold everything got my fish there I remember putting my hand in the tin the tank and trying to pet them and stuff like that and growing up I started getting into fishing and obviously by the water you know surfing so obsessed with this stuff and then when I turn 16 I got my first job and I worked at a pet shop where they actually taught me to build acrylic aquariums and next thing you know maintain them and I learned a lot through their work there from the middle of high school in the beginning beginning of college and then during that time I also volunteered at the what is now known as the Ocean Institute I used to be known as an Orange County Marine Institute over there in the Dana Point for a few years and then I moved on to the Aquarium of the Pacific where I actually volunteered there for a year and an XE Nino I was put on paid staff for about six years or so and that's where it really caught the bug for whales marine mammals and I worked as a naturalist on the boats over there that Harbor Breeze did with the aquarium I used us folks in the education department at the aquarium as their naturalist and I loved it you know I was like just literally just obsessed with whales after my first few whale watch trip so did that for years I started learning more and more about them and you know started going to conferences is everything and next thing you know I was like I want to make this my life and then I was lucky enough to get the opportunity by Dana Wharf I'm a good buddy Carla you know hey you know what they need someone at Dana Wharf so I talked to a Donna over there and next thing you know I was there full-time they taught me how to manage the place for a bit so I got to spend some time on the boat and yeah I've really got to full-on into the field there and I learned a lot there so thank you Donna and Thank You Carla for linking me up with that and next thing you know they stole me and brought me here to monitor a so the killer will still do you stole you good yeah so that's what brought you to Monterey - that would be my other question for you Slater what why Monterey yeah the whales the whales it's like shooting fish in a barrel that's actually so okay how about this what was the first time you heard about how crazy good it was in Monterey like was there an instant I have an instant where I was like oh man I got to get down there yeah you know like Shane's photos yeah Shane kina I think I'm pretty sure I saw like a breaching humpback or something yeah when I was in Newport and I remember like Larry was like oh yeah there's a place in Monterey Mike it's only five hours from here like it's we can go there the first time I drove up first time I drove up didn't check the weather got here all trips canceled for two days and then I was like yeah cool looking outside and I'm arguing with the guy at the obvious I'm like dude it's not even bad out there so it's Black Hawk it's like he's like yeah but and then you could we went over by the aquarium and looked out and like you know you see out past the point now and it's freaking out there those gym yeah so I remember what happened to me was I probably had caused a little controversy over this but Kate Kate Cummings she did started this 8 hour trip you know and a bunch of us down south heard about and we're like oh man we got you know try this company and they're doing these all day trips so the fuel was from Southern California all Caravan I know you guys like having this whole little SoCal component going on Kate's boat I was like who are all these people I kept together to go on we just Caravan down here with Shane my good buddy Christina what SoCal yeah but we we know how to handle the good weather yeah we came and we just the amount of humpbacks and everything here you know it was just amazing and we were literally just obsessed with the place to the point where we'd coming down here in the last minute we're here there is a good you know good I know you achieve especially yeah all the sudden the next morning here good stretch of Orca sightings I believe drives dude like it's noth-nothing for Derek yeah yeah I actually love to drive I take the long route with a four or five one on one just along the water use research trip on the bay here yeah yeah unbelievable it was like humpback soup and it still is you know and that's what got me dead humpbacks Margo and I Margeaux came with me for my first like trip I met at that time or maybe it was the second time I met you guys came at one time and I we came before I did everything and like it was better than the last two summers I mean there were so 14:15 yeah and there were so many humming wheels we couldn't move the boat for like you know hours yeah and I remember they were like oh we're leaving to see some common dolphins and I was like I was looking at some my older photos you know from like my first few trips here and just like in one one frame you know it's like I'm looking at like there's a hat I have to have been able to beat that right or someone has to have more than that oh yeah the fall of 2015 I have photos where there's like 11 open mouths in one frame yeah it's crazy because it's like once you see that you like crave to see that again yeah well they'd still be lunch meeting in two hours I mean yeah just on 2013 when that crazy you know that fall when the whales stayed late through Thanksgiving it made national news from Monterey it was like in New York Times it was all over the news and it ran in the newspaper in Oregon and my mom and I saw it and we were I was at home for Thanksgiving break from college and my mom what the heck look at this so then we got on the internet and started looking at all the companies that were all there sightings like the YouTube videos from Chris's and photos throwing all the Facebook pages and we were like let's go how long we googled how long it takes to drive there and we're like sitting there we're like if we leave now it's 8 p.m. we drive all night we could be there in the morning get on the morning wheel out to my dad was like stop okay I can't I can't do the whole even I ain't get there the morning like you know does that Lahti does that yeah she leaves and then she leaves right after the all-day trip and drives back home I'm like dad I don't know Southern California yeah Southern California's are actually pretty famous for making that run just like poke the brakes you - me and my mom are on the computer trying to figure out how to go and then we decided to go winter break instead for gray whales which was also like I just done the gray whale census like the Oregon version of the census for a week it was cold and foggy I had a fire at my station all all week because it was so cold we saw one whale in five days and then we get to Monterey 30 whales in an hour I was like they had to swim by us if you don't know what a census is that's what Chilean county way yeah so in certain places it depends on what else they do while they're counting the whales but you're there's all these locations you pick down the coastline and you're taking just a count by the hour of how many whales you see as they're migrating and then for the ones in Oregon the whale watching spoken here program you also are an interpreter so you talk to people about what you're doing while you're doing it and you have like a display box where you have like a rope that shows how long the whale is and a piece of baleen and pictures and things like that I'll never forget when I went to the census in Marseille for the first time oh yeah and I walked up like and I knew people there but they only knew me from my facebook so I like I was like yeah there's a well right there like whatever and there's markings you know the fence yeah they never rolled out and they were like who are you oh that's it he works on the you know the ocean Explorer or whatever and they're like I walk up and right away I felt right right away I find a way I felt really good yeah that's Ross that census was really fun to volunteer yeah a lot of good people working there and yeah at least it's got some pretty hardcore people out there I don't know if you see the picture she puts up every now and then but even through the sweater we've been dealing with David rain sleet or whatever yeah and then there's some of the captains some of the captains over there I remember I kind of appreciate the census must count yeah yeah some of the cabbage over there can i no appreciated the people if this episode is a big call-out stuff ever now that I member one day they actually brought up he goes the captain from the Voyager actually brothers hot chocolate it's sunrise to sunset - yeah yeah the census people like to like yeah the census people actually opened the gate over there and everything so yeah first ones there an argument we're not that intense but yeah we're there for quite a bit of the bay I think the Santa Barbara ones about to start to write the I think they count northbound only their coal point and then there's another one up in Northern California yep point yeah I bet they didn't count very many great whales this year cuz the weather's been bad but hopefully it'll improve while they're counting the northbound migration yeah you guys better count twenty two thousand six hundred forty three yeah it's going up twenty five yeah but I thought it was that like max guessing it well they're in capacity yeah jury's kind of out on that because they're still trying to figure out the nuances of the three different potentially three different groups of gray whales the West's are in the eastern and the Pacific feeding the Pacific okay so exactly for maybe our true westerns and then the last few years we've had continuous record-breaking numbers of cabs right Indians so like that's not necessarily a sign of a population at carrying capacity so we're still we're still trying to hash that all out but those census people should have some fun because northbounders usually a little bit close to the shore so we'll see what happens what uh what do you guys think it will do each of our opinions I think on this one what do you guys think the best way to get into whale watching or into this type of industry with whales you know what I always put we get asked this question a lot especially on the boat even when I was at the aquarium to but one thing I've noticed is it seems like the people who get their foot in the door first happy the Vantage it's honestly now it's it's no longer that they go degree at times yeah it's it's the people who are I see volunteering at the aquariums you know networking with people getting those internships you know working their butt off going to those workshops and conferences and networking and meeting you know these people that they're looking up to and you know sending out their emails to I can actually yep yeah it is that way nowadays and I see it you know a lot out there I mean I can first example social me is a perfect example I see people after putting up all these pictures of whales they love whales I can tell but I don't see him at conferences that I don't see I'm an ACS meetings I don't see him at workshops you know you got to get out there and you know meet people show them your potential show them how you are you know show them you're really into this and that's one thing I guys say is get your foot in the door no matter it be workshops internships volunteering you know just go out there get your foot in the door meet people yeah yeah well it can be it can be kind of tough because I feel like this is increasingly true in a lot of fields but it is very true in the Marine Mammal world a lot of places want you to work for free and that's really hard for some people you know I got like I said earlier when how did I get to Monterey I almost ran out of money where I started getting paid and I was like oh no I might have to move back to Jamaica I come in here yeah it sounds like mean or whatever but I mean we all did I took a cut because I just wanted to be up here I didn't yeah at the time yeah and so that can be that can be limiting for a lot of people to have to volunteer to get your foot in the door but there are other opportunities like especially on the west coast there's American cetacean Society chapters in other you know Natural History and education groups like that that hosts free lectures that are also a meeting you know regularly especially in Monterey oh my god there's something like at least twice or three times a week all month long in our area where you can go and listen to the talks and meet people and just chitchat and even if you're kind of intimidated about that maybe just asking one good question at the end of the talk or making one connection could lead you to a whole new set of opportunities yeah especially for us to live you know along the coast here east coast or west coast you literally have no excuse guys I mean especially here in the Monterey Bay man we got how many marine labs around here you know you got the Monterey Bay Aquarium you got Moss Landing Marine Lab you got Hopkins marine station you know you got embark you got UC Santa Cruz long Marine Lab bans the Seymour Center there are that many opportunities out there down south you know Caitlin's mentioning ACS you got obviously ACS in San Diego Orange County LA Orange County and LA offer that naturalist course yeah that is something I've seen a lot of a lot of good people who have made it you know into the field into paying positions or mid-career who gone through those programs and it's it's it's not expensive you know it's it's worth the membership fees and it's worth meeting those people so if you really want to do it go for it so things like that going to a few events like that or like kind of interacting with those circles you'll realize how small the field it is everyone will start to look real familiar real fast a lot of people do know each other or at least know of each other we're a perfect example all three of us the new week of each other before we met each other yeah exactly and it's not ever too late to start getting involved in something you're passionate about either is what I tell people you know I've I have people come up that are like my parents age or older on the boat and really Wow I wanted to do marine biology when I was a kid and then it just you know it just never worked out I'm like it's not too late like if you are really passionate about it you can volunteer once a week at your local museum or aquarium and interact with the public about something you're passionate about I mean you know people come to this field in all kinds of interesting ways and and if you are looking to like start it as a college student one of the best little mini lectures I got from a PhD candidate who was I was teeing for at Oregon State was she was like when I look at who I'm gonna take in the field I don't really care what their grades are yeah there's some formalities with that for you know being admitted to the lab and everything but what I really want to know before I take someone to the South Pacific for three months is how good is your handwriting and how good are you at taking notes on a boat and do you get seasick and the last thing is if the boat breaks down are you helpful are you helpful to me because that's the kind of work environment where like you have to be value added in some way shape or form and and sometimes it's not the book smarts part of it it's like can you cooperate on the belt can you take good field notes and are you a trooper and like really shitty weather for five days later a perfect example you know having been up working on a fishing boat first you know you deal up a little bit different you know type of atmosphere on a whale-watching boat so yeah I think my Robin do is much different than yours especially kaitland yeah I was working I was my next-door neighbor brought me on the fishing boat and used to pick me up every morning at 5:00 in the morning and I'd work you know double half-day so six to 12 and then 12:30 to 5:30 every single day on the weekends until I was in high school and I started ditching school to go on the boat as soon as I graduated I started leaving my college classes to go because there was private charters that could be done so I I think that a good way to get you know what the to be able to see well the stuff is trying to get a job at a whale company whether it be in the office or you know a deckhand on the boat and a good way to become a deck on the bow is actually go on the boat multiple times ask them if they need help if you could scrub the boat if you could do things like that because if you could provide them value then you know you're more likely to get seen and then on top of that yeah going in the office and trying to get a job up there because on your days off you're definitely gonna be allowed to go for free yeah and I know that it's see I've seen a lot of emails come into the office and I've gotten messages that say like are you hiring you know for the whale watch company and I know there's a lot of applications that come in but if you actually go in the door and ask you know you're better better than just sending an email in yeah I mean I'm more inclined to advocate for an applicant if they've if they've applied but then also come down and like met the crew so we can kind of see what kind of person they are because the other thing about especially working on boats is it really has to be a mesh of personalities when you're in a small workspace that can be kind of heist depending on the weather and you're interacting with a lot of people trying to provide a good customer service experience we really need to know what your attitude and personalities like before we're gonna just take you on as a cold read so if you're down here you're already you know shaking hands and meeting us and seeing if you're a good fit with us that's gonna speak volumes more for you than just sending an email I know so many people that when I was working on the phishing bear so many kids at that time they're all older now they literally came out every weekend when I was art here when I became a deckhand these kids would come out and all they did was take fish off you know and then scrub the boat of them of the day and then now they're all 18 19 and they all work on the boats and some of them are captains now so yeah I think another thing is people gotta realize it's a it's a lifestyle you know it's occur if you're gonna make it a career yeah exactly like that see it's not that crazy for people for people like us you know us three we I mean we you know where he really are out at sea like pretty much every day as much as we can and you're working for companies that sometimes are mom and pop so I'll be honest with you guys you know don't expect that 401 K no I expect full benefits you know if you want to do this you really kind of it's tough but I'll tell you why I'm I'm pretty happy you know I get to see my animals that you have to just love what you do they mean they come exactly working exactly you gotta love what you what you do guys you know I love these animals I love seeing them every day and you know so I'm one of the lucky ones who actually get paid to go out there and share my love and talk about yeah definitely lucky to be able to get paid to do what we do whales yeah yeah and I think if you guys work hard enough and you want to do this yeah you work hard enough you can you can do it but there's you know there's some less glamorous days on the notion that I'm sure but you know it's so worth it it's so worth it I said one day we had a friendly whale and the captain and I were standing on the top deck was just watching this whale like flirt with the boat and he was like this makes up for all the days where we were in the engine room - for Stephanie last season yeah 2018 it seems like we have a lot of that - a lot of memorable moments out there that are worth it yeah the yucky weather it's not or I have enough people having a hard time with the yucky weather is also like you you gotta get some thick skin to be around a lot of seasick people like it's all right we're gonna it's gonna be okay we're gonna get through it as a photographer sometimes I mean I lose the creativity or like the inspiration but like the motivation yeah because if you go 10 or 15 days in a row and it's like you know you see whales but it's not like outdoing yourself every time or something yeah I can lose a little bit of motivation but then it's like you have you you still know that you got to keep going because you know it's that one day that your wife forces you to get out of the car and go you see you know offshore killer whales eat a shark right yeah yeah yeah yeah you can get fatigued pretty easily and even if every day has been like you know 10 to 15 lunch feeding humpbacks which is incredible it's funny you'll be like oh god you're just doing the same thing again today and it's like are you kidding I know it's like you talked to someone down south and like we had one humpback I'm like and like you almost feel bad saying like oh yeah we had 27 off backs today I get it in a backflip it's like they're like they did that yesterday we're like yeah we know be a sailor more check more times your outfit more likely you're gonna you know that magical moments gonna happen or that one species you always wanted to see is just gonna show up but you go ahead turn I was like like camera remember last year you guys are bugging me about the whole letter back thing oh yeah well guess what we saw them I didn't pound it yeah and then one day we saw two differently I won't get to see that but me and Eric just bumped so he know how you know how rare letter backs are especially in our part of world yeah seeing two in one day is quite a feat and Caitlyn Turner has not seen the one yet yeah brood he knows funniest I was like on the roof of the Sir Randy and we were headed towards I think your horizon new horizon yeah to me listen listen listen listen Linda we were and I was like dude I think they're one of those leatherbacks innit what do you know we turn it was 11:00 and then all the boats came everybody's looking at this letter back you're my fire this is one time this letter back [Music] on the side of its mouth I gotta go I gotta go back you marry mommy back oh my gosh I have to send you guys a video just being on the water no matter how bad it is yeah your chances of seeing something you know just increase it just by being out there like art like our trusted social media advisor Gary B says you just gotta have gratitude every day [Laughter] something else what it you can be happy not making a lot of money if you're doing what you love yep so you can make $20,000 or you can make a million dollars and if you just enjoy what you're doing then it doesn't matter how much you make I mean we get to do something it can be stressful you can't pay your bills but we need to do something that people literally save for a bucket list you have to do once and we get to do it for a living it's pretty amazing speaking of that have you ever had like a bucket list person like on your boat yeah for sure all the time yeah so many people that information when they tell me that yeah you know who the law was Chris used to always walk on back who's first time seeing well and you know and everybody raised dad yeah there's a lot of you know what I want to talk about actually and I was think about this a couple days ago you know how many people I've wrote me and said I went whale watching on a school trip when I was kid we didn't see anything you know and they like don't want to go again cuz they think that but it's funny because you know you hear a lot of people that worked here well 10 years ago they didn't see anything either they didn't see a lot of whales here but now everything's starting to come back and yeah things are changing so definitely if you haven't gone because you had a past experience where you didn't see whales now's the time because a lot of places that weren't seeing whales are seeing wells now so and I feel like company's abilities to get information out using the internet and social media and review pages and things like that is just increasing people's awareness of like there to go and when because like what if you totally went in the offseason and a company was just like running boat tours and you thought you were gonna see whales cuz I was well on the sign but like that wasn't actually the end game of the trip you know so companies are getting better about setting expectations and like getting the information to people about when to go and and I think it's getting better for you to figure out like where you should go which is Monterey you can go wherever you can go definitely it's a lot easier to do your research at and we gotta invite us because we want to go anyway I was getting back to that bucket listing I just we actually had an older guy we were unaware but I guess one of our crew members was talking to his family and I guess the guy actually had terminal cancer and his bucket list thing was to see you well honey got companies I used to work or did make a wish that one was always like because it's such a good feeling when you know someone just like accomplished a huge goal yeah you know yeah just like the same we get when we see a new species or we see something that we haven't seen in a long time or you know it's just like that feeling is amazing yeah especially when you get to share it with other people on the boat that's I think one of the best feelings about working on a whale which boat is watching because we've seen the humpback lunch for you but when you see you and you have so like 60 people on the boat that I've never seen it like light up because their first time seeing it and sometimes I don't get why you're so excited like the beat whales you know I gotta tell people like okay guys I've been down the water 30 years and you know this is like the first time I'm seeing these and then they finally hits I'm like oh you know why is this guy running up and down the rails bro man crying Barrett's beep whales yeah I was getting pretty emotional I did tell these people like the crew actually sent me a heads-up when they saw them because they knew he was gonna come back in and be like some feeling some type of way so they wanted me to be prepared I'm always like if I see this I'm gonna cry but then it happens I don't cry but I want to I want to cry I think if I see right whales this man I can't I don't have time to cry because if I cry then I can't see to the viewpoint missus schott sobriety can't be missing John no crying in baseball there's no crying you know what you can cry when the killer whales eat gray whales it makes me sad even gray whales you know like I find it so fascinating you really yeah it made me sad when we watch that see my dad get out of the water fifty times okay but I was just like I felt was dramatic yeah what we saw like skipping out of the wall I think the worst part was when his buddy put his flipper around oh yeah we were like just like there was another side the other sea line it was like right underneath it right but yeah like come on let's go like tapping him and as soon as it came around the table hit it again he would dip out of the way and they kept hitting the same one yeah it was bad that was a gnarly predation I don't know we video that like a moment we can't explain because I'll tell you why we didn't video because the killer will breach right in front of us and got Herrick what go all of us wait on the back of the boat I'll never forget that Eric was very emotional after that as well yeah there's like I just got splashed over Eric just an emotional guy about it anyway you know else Erica I have I love it well selfies with animals shoot you and I have a selfie together that mommy took Kaylin we have a song have a selfie with a letter set up oh nice really I need to get a little sound you get like a little sound thing where but even gray whales like I always have to tell people especially not from around here is like this animal can only be seen in the normal Pacific now you know if you're from the Atlantic I saw her on any other ocean he I really see these so yeah you gotta learn how to tell people how special that moment is you know I think northern right whale dolphins are so really special to me yeah I don't know exists yeah I didn't know they excited when I thought I even I think I already already lived here for like a year then I found out that they had him here and I was like yeah they didn't have a dorsal fin I'm Michael what like oh my I I can't believe I didn't know I'm pretty sure I didn't know that for like at least a year oh yeah no dorsal fin that's how much they don't show you you know they don't sure they can not show up or I can miss them that's why you guys wanna be on the water as much as possible just never know what might happen out there do you guys know anything about this southern right whale dolphins do you know where they're at I think you can't even Australia South like South Pole no because if you guys find out I would like to go there because well we're cousins and northern right whale dolphins don't allow me to take photos of them but maybe these are more travel places you know our good friend Pete Pete Garbett maybe he knows our Facebook friend yeah where you at Pete have you been listening to this podcast I need to know um let's see are you seeing what do they say you can't see them way south but you can see them like everywhere South America South Africa Australia New Zealand what what are you gotta go you guys out he's upset sailors mad no we owe you guys a credit card let's just for going to see well yeah oh yeah we can make this credit card and we'll have this Penthouse and only the credit card members can go to credit card I'll have a dolphin on it and it would be really heavy and metallic yeah [Laughter] in case you guys don't know we're talking about yeah right well if dolphins really neat streamlined dolphin that has no dorsal fin so lizard elfish yeah they're pretty amazing she's there's a northern and a southern and we can see the northern here the southern apparently is pretty common I mean its range is wide I shouldn't say it's common its range is wide and that's another kind of caveat about the northern right whale dolphin is there's lots of them but you don't see them near shore very often they're typically a pretty open ocean pelagic species and they just kind of come into the bay and then they make their way back out of the bay to do you feel like the Pacific white-sided dolphins are very pelagic as well I wouldn't I would I think yeah I mean Southern California guys have them kind of cold no we only see them along the coast really yeah but in my I've never seen like a pod like five miles out of you I've only seen them alone they should moderate we just see him they like buzz through every once in a while and couple hundred or you know small is 30 to 50 and then then they're gone again they're so cool yeah the seafloor mixing he I think they know they're cool difference for our side yeah like Rizzo's Rizzo's back in Southern California offshore because it's I mean a deeper water we're squid out there here you know where our water drops off a lot faster Bay I mean I've seen it as those from I'm sure I've seen them from the harbor sometimes I go love Instagram in the office like my office right now someone came from Southern California and they they went on the boat and I think they were with you Eric and they saw Rizzo's just in front of you know like right in front of ya the aquarium and they were like they wrote me on Instagram I was actually in Hawaii and they said do you guys have originals like right here yeah like so that that drop makes a huge difference alright well I think you guys learned a little bit about us and about how we got into Wales and how we got jobs on whale watching boat yeah and now you possibly could get a job on a whale watching boat or in the field yeah and we're worse like we said in another episode I think maybe episode six we talked about this we started on our pod bean site we started a page for resources so when we come across things that are helpful or have good information we're making a list on there so one of the ways I heard about the internship that kind of started it all in Monterey for me was on that Marmon listserv from University of Victoria and so we have that on there we have a couple other things and we'll keep adding to the list as we go so you can always reference that and check that out if you're looking for ideas and then you're welcome to reach out to us online - I did have someone messaged me the other day and it was asking me some questions about how to get involved and I gave kind of similar talk like topics and tips that we were talking about here so definitely definitely reach out to us we're happy to and share some or resource pages anything yeah first one will will Gilmore gave us a recommendation of a book called Neptune's Ark what is this science where you guys know I can't read that from here that's way too small I know it'd be a source yeah a key Authority it gave the Souris hey keep the source get your Santa memes alright so thank you for that recommendation and yeah yeah guys so yeah feel free to like I said reach out to people feel free to reach out to us you can find this all on Instagram and what else I was thinking after going live on Instagram tonight that was kind of fun maybe we could do some sort of livestream like on Twitch and people can come in and ask live questions and we can hang out and chat and eat snacks in I'm game they're snacks I'm in yes all there's snacks hopefully not crunchy ones were hanging out me I mean we like hanging out with you yeah I like Slater time anyways if you guys think that that you guys would be interested in us it could be even like a Facebook live or twitch whatever but if you guys are interested let us know somehow reach out its Aram yeah we'd love to hear what you what you guys want because we want to be able to get all this information out to you in ways this can be easy for you that's that's kind of your point help us help you and keep those topics coming in also yeah I think of my favorite thing to answer her to talk about was really when they asked us topics I mean cuz we can try to come up with some but I like when they ask questions me too yeah more questions the better all right you guys well thanks for listening if you made it this far I hope you guys enjoyed episode number eight woohoo and I hope you guys all have a great rest of your day alright thanks for listening everyone yeah thank you

-

hello everyone and welcome back to the well Nerds podcasts this is episode 9 and I'm hanging out with Eric and Kaitlin hey everyone hi my name is Slater and we're excited to be back for a 9th episode I can't believe we're already this far yeah I think I say that every yeah we started like last night last week what are we talking about today did you want to answer any quick questions off the Instagram we have just so you guys know we have a running list of all the topics so thanks for sending in those comments on the Instagram posts and on the story when we have the little polls up there we are writing them all down did you have any ones that we could answer pretty quickly because we do have some yes I got one this is one I want to get off my chest this one's from Jordan and he said is it killer whale or Orca or both ah here we go this one gets me going on my comments you want to go or you want me look want us to speak our piece first it's it's it's all gonna be the same answer once yeah you do some research on it the answer is always gonna be the same and it's all about the history of the animals scientific name and the meaning Orson is Orca yes listen I see them kill whales so they're killer whales the ones that I watch are killer whales yeah they are called killer whales because we've seen them kill whales and they kill sharks and they kill fish yeah they kill yeah seals and sea lions may be new in this forever so that's how they earned their scientific name and they know it's not like they're super nice to the other animal yeah all right guys Toma Orson that's organic Orca basically like demon from below yeah yeah not a good time from below so I mean take your pick killer whale or demon from the depths I mean they're both pretty gnarly I go with killer people the reason why people think you shouldn't say killer is because it's like the same reason you know we are the same feeling they get when you talk about sharks they've they've portrayed them as these evil things when they're not yeah so I think that's why people don't like the word killer I get it but it's also how all of us talk like in the you know field I guess everywhere you everywher I've been that scene orcas you know San Juan Islands here SoCal everybody says killer whales yeah even they're like top researchers I also think about translating it into other languages like if I'm speaking to someone it's in Spanish in the office I definitely say Orca because like killer whale straight-across translated doesn't really come through but in English when when I'm narrating on the boat as natural as I say killer whale yeah I think it gets the point across yeah click and to the point you'll look at titles to a lot of scientific research papers and articles out there no it's it's straight out killer whales guys so even you know people we see as experts out there refer to them as killer whales so I honestly don't get all bent out of shape when people call them one or the other I get more bent out of shape when people argue about because it's so easy to literally just you know do your research and find out the history of the word and if you actually experienced the animal oh man I've seen them kill little I've seen them kill whales I've seen kill sea lions I mean Slayers even kill birds no punt watch this pod attack one rhinoceros Auklet for like thirty five plus minutes yeah it was they would let it run then they're that kind of tim was calling it a you know mur hacky-sack that settles that we like it if you call them orcas killer whales or black and white dolphins whatever we understand it we get it yeah maybe not black and white dolphins because there's a lot of black and white sometimes we say that isn't code as amongst the crew because we don't want to get people excited without actually finding them first I like to be cool and just calm qdubs qdubs all right let's see let's go back to another question from the Instagram what is currently being done to protect whales from ship strikes and entanglements oh yeah there's it's that's actually both matters are very very very ongoing issues I can I'll touch on the ship strike really quick and then maybe Caitlin could touch on the rest but especially us who live in the well actually for all of us who live in LA in the California area it's ship strike is of great concern because we have some of the busiest ports in the world literally in our state so for example Northern California we got the San Francisco Bay down in Southern California we obviously have the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach combined it's one of the busiest ports in the world and container ships that some of the biggest ones are about a thousand feet long and believe it or not travel at a high rate of speed travel up and down our coast and the reason why we're here right now because we're talking about are the whales that are up and down our coast so the lanes that the ships travel and there's literally shipping lanes that's what they're called and the whale is unfortunately frequent those shipping lanes and there have been some adjustments out there but nothing seems to be a hundred percent obviously the whales don't go oh that's a shipping lane I better stay out of it their habit has been talked to slow down the ship's that's probably our best bet but some of these companies will not do it why because today I'm time is money there has even been an incentive for them certain organizations have offered them money but it's like a couple thousand bucks into a huge shipping County shipping company that's thoroughly you about a couple thousand bucks is laughable it's like whatever you know it's pocket change to them there has even been some more talk about maybe putting some type of device on the ships that will tell the wells to back off and stuff like that but that doesn't you know seem to be working there's even the as well alert the app systems yes yeah well are kind of having people let you know these container ships know that there is a well in the area but go for it exactly so once again time is money it's also kind of a snapshot so that NOAA and some conservation groups like point blue conservation can look at like how often the overlap is of whales and shipping so that they can maybe influence regulations down the line so they're trying to get like a historical record of how often what species are in the shipping lanes too so even the instant factor is really helpful but also like having that archive of data to show like look this is a very clear overlap for this species and this is a maybe this is a better lane a couple years ago I listened to some really good talks at the Marine Mammal conference in San Francisco did you know so there was two one was the the shipping lane report card system in the Atlantic Ocean approaching the eastern seaboard of the United States in the right whale conservation areas and they first of all have a report card system so everybody gets like this badge of honor that they can promote themselves with they also get certificates on the ships because they use the AIS so the global tracking system of the GPS is on the ships to track their rate of speed as they approach going through the right whale designated areas and so if they comply and they're ten knots are slower than they get like a report card and so the companies actually have started to take it on as a point of pride they've like use this good like this good version of peer pressure to get them all to comply and if the ships are traveling less than 10 knots they're actually way more likely to have a non-fatal collision with the whale doesn't matter what size of boat it is if it's traveling less than ten knots any size well I think the rate of a fatal strike goes down more than 70% it might even be 90 per one say that magic number was about 10 to 12 knots they want them to yeah under 10 knots the most the time the collision will not be fatal and so it was really interesting to hear that and then that same conference there was a couple tech companies there because some ships in New Zealand where they have Brutus Wales at one of the major ports is using infrared to detect the blows at night so when the ships are coming into the port they can like use this infrared set of binoculars basically like kind of like big eyes on the boat these high-powered binoculars that are mounted on the bridge and they can avoid the whales coming into the port although that was pretty interesting that's pretty interesting to me is that like when it comes to the blue whales and the fin whales being so big especially the blue whales they're not really scared of boats so I mean I don't think they're scared they don't really have very many natural predators I mean orcas but that's very rare for them to attack a blue whale and so I don't think they're scared of very much so for them to stop when it boats coming out I think they don't worry about it yeah the biggest thing yeah there's been some cases where they have kind of went into the direction of the cargo ship so yeah sometimes they tried the pingers on the ships to try and emit just like this noise and it made the but the whales either like turn and come towards the boat or it made them surface so then that's when they're even more susceptible to getting hit by the boat is when they're at the surface and so the the coup stick deterrent was gonna work and after talking or listening to John Callen Katie's talk on the blue whales it was they were surfacing more at nighttime - right that's when they were happening yeah yeah they have put on those suction cup tags that stay on for maybe a day at the max and the blue whales are not feeding as much at night and they're spending a lot more time at the surface and the ships come in day and night because they're just using you know electronics to navigate in the dark and so they definitely can't see a whale when that's happening it's amazing that we don't see or hear about more ship strikes well most of them go unreported because they are happening offshore and a lot of these companies are are not going to say something you know what that happens and be honest with you I think sometimes they really don't even know what happened you know sometimes they come all the way into the port and then all of a sudden people are like oh my god and the shipping crew has no idea that there's a whale wrapped around the bow of the boat which is crazy because you've seen those images of like a fin well yeah the boat well I haven't seen a newer image like that in a while yeah nothing very recent I know two years ago was the most recent I've seen you know there is that fin whale that was taken into connects to the Cabrillo Aquarium maybe it was before I move so maybe about three years ago or so or maybe more or less that was drugging but I think that might have been a ship strike victim also that blue whale now I want to go see in June that was also ship strike on a tow below yeah there was a humpback whale at beam Hollow State Beach two years three years three years ago too and that one was a ship strike but yeah I haven't seen photos of one come in wrapped on the bow into the port of San Francisco for a couple years but um to circle back to the entanglement part of the question so that's a very hot topic in every state on the west coast so Oregon Washington and California are unified by this thing called Pacific Fisheries Management Council and then they have their own local like state Fish and Wildlife right regulatory agencies as well and so each States agency is taking on this problem kind of more relevant to their own state but then also communicating and I think they use the management council as part of that network in California there's a what's called a Dungeness crab working group because their gear has been identified as one of the most common offending types of gear for whale entanglements on the west coast the there's kind of a caveat to that because they mark their gear the best out of all the Fisheries that's why it's the most reported but it is also more of a nearshore fisheries that'sthat's pretty prevalent up and down the west coast so just kind of like odds are it's gonna be Dungeness crab gear and so there are some groups go right now to figure out if there's a better way to do that there was some good prototypes at the Halifax Marine Mammal conference two years ago where they had rope list gear there was one that was like this lift bag that was like a co2 canister so it's like a garage door opener and RFID triggered switch turn inflated the bag and then the whole trap came up and so everything sat on the bottom and then there was no ropes in the water which is the dangerous part I know in the East Coast they're testing a couple different models with the blue crab and lobster fisheries because those are severe entanglement risk factors for right whales and they had a lot and humpback whales they had a lot of whale deaths last year and it actually caused the blue crab season to close early maybe that's 2017 but yeah there's definitely a lot of work going on a lot of prototype testing but part of me is also kind of like it's been 400 years we've been using the same method can we yeah I think I remember a lot of the talk about it was about the Robles gear and other types of technology - or drops was the the cost but there is talk that some of the the technology like all technology out there you know it's getting a little cheaper because I know there's actually some stuff out there even for you recognize I think they were pushing some stuff even for recreational guys that's Robles so maybe something nice and heavy-duty and affordable for commercial guys is is coming up soon yeah the crab raft technology actually was originally developed for recreational fishermen and they're trying to figure out how to scale it up for commercial right now hopefully we can figure out better ways to do this yeah yeah you guys depressed now what I know is you can have all the almost all the world's answers in your pocket on a cell phone these days I have faith that we're going to be able to figure out a safer way to deliver the world's goods and to feed people seafood in a way that's more sustainable yeah all right so that was a great question and yeah that I think those two issues are yeah the probably leading cause of large whale demise worldwide yes yes as far as the numbers of animals affected you guys want to touch on something a little bit more upbeat where are going with questions from our listeners right yes yeah actually one of them that I actually got from one of our buddies Hannah back from Orange County one of the naturalist over there and I think Slayer you've been asked us a lot what obviously you are known for your photography so what's your people just want to know basic tips you know out there like how do you get all these amazing shots well the first thing is YouTube tutorials on photoshop now honestly I have a few tips going we're watching as much as you can is obviously gonna put you and more opportunities to get shots that you're gonna want and high shutter speed the boats moving there's probably when the whales are moving to having that high shutter speed I always recommend at least above 2000 when photographing whales and another thing is having a lens that has the distance to reach the animals there is guidelines that were recommended to say 100 yards which is 300 feet and although they can turn and come towards you a lot of the times of whales are kept at 300 or more feet so having a lens that can reach that I always recommend something at least 300 millimeters or above I personally use a 100 to 400 millimeter Canon lens and I've never felt that I've needed anything more than that also when you're carrying the lens that does have more reached into 400 millimeter lens a lot of times they're heavy so it makes it kind of hard to maneuver around the boat especially you don't a whack your neighbor when a whale does come across that boat so yeah something versatile like a 100 to 400 or a 70 to 300 is a great lens for photographing whales and dolphins alright sounds good now you know I know some of our folks here probably aren't as lucky as I'm able to get on boats all the times and you mentioned you know just being out there a lot practicing yeah be shot anything else like you know birds or any other animals or just landscape just for practice that's actually one of my tips when if you can't go well watching if you have like a what is it wetland yeah or a slough or something that has birds or some animals that come to it that's one of the best places you can practice shooting something that's moving that'll help you with you know photographing whales or dolphins she your hummingbirds in your back you have like a beautiful garden with some elegant hummingbirds they're fun but they can be hard to even for you know professional photographers they're still pretty tricky so any major difference between like shooting you know like dolphins and whales I know there is but I just want people to know like what do you recommend to do well the thing is you could shoot a bird at a slower shutter speed because you really you want to stop the bird the you know the head of the bird and have that sharp but some people like to have the wings in motion so you can shoot a bird like 1250 or 1600 and it'll stop the face but the wings will still be in motion so that's you know that's kind of unique to how you want to see your image but when shooting whales or dolphins you really have to have this high shutter speed otherwise your dolphins kind of look blurry and it's just not gonna look you know clear or sharp cool yeah good yes it sounds ready to go photograph some whales now I know obviously well photography you just looked online Instagram and everything it's a big thing some people make their livings off of it rights later but it's not just for like the likes and entertainment I'm glad lot of photographers right now are putting it to good use in fact you know I'm not big on photography but you know I'll pull out that camera when it's something amazing or if I can I'll use it for ID purposes especially out here in the bay you know when we get our our Orca or our humpbacks out it's good to know who they are so no a lot of our photos now are being used for identification and one of the easiest ways to get your wale ID'd and I think a lot of our even our listeners are using is happy well especially for our humpback whales out there with a simple photo of the animals tail aka flukes the underside you can pretty much put them online and sometimes it's almost instantly if you submit it too happy will you'll get an answer of who that whale is and even sometimes a little bio on that animal I know all three of us have submitted photos on there how many you had a lot you had something you want to give it to me right I have so many loops that I have not turned in you know what I did when I first started doing it because I had so many photos as I just gave Ted Cheeseman a hard drive and was like here you go yeah but that was when I was like sorting all the photos by species and flukes and then I was just like here because I don't have the time to upload each individual one but I think I'm bad as being organizing my flukes for happy well but I will try to get better I can told me you can just give them to me I'll do it for you started working here wait will you do mine yes okay I want to say something though if you are trying to get into the whale watching field whether it's a naturalist or just some somewhere in this field it is good to have a camera because you might be on the boat and see something that no one's seen so yeah it does kind of go hand-in-hand with like marine biology and all that stuff in general so yeah it's good to even if it's not the best camera in the world it's still good to have one yeah I mean I think Eric and I definitely would consider ourselves like Amateur wildlife photographers too because we both have cameras and when something interesting is happening it's it's good to document like for the science part and it's also fun like sometimes you get really nice shots which is cool yeah I know both you guys have stuff that I don't have and that's just because you're there on a day that I wasn't I was yeah taking photos is fun everyone and you'll be surprised sometimes the simplest thing will actually help out the scientific community that's what makes happy well so fun I mean it's for everyone it's not just a bunch of marine biologists the general public can submit a photo and and the simple photo can figure out an animal's migration pattern just by simply simply you know repetitive sightings you know in different locations sometimes you can even give you the sex of the animal for example you see Oh a year after year after year and all son has a calf next to it you figure it out one it's a female - you might have even figured out its its age you know for example certain animals are sexually mature at a certain age so just like that you got a guesstimate its age so simple things like that are really helpful the cool thing about happy well I like is that it's kinda like just like any social media you can follow the whale and you'll get a notification with the whales reefs potted so you kind of got a permanent souvenir there and it's kind of cool to see a whale that you saw in Monterey pop-up and you know in Cabo San Lucas somewhere or even further yeah you should do an ID trip only it'll be kind of fine you guys if we do all day trips you know and we want to explore so we should do like not so all day trip but just like in front of Moss Landing trip where we just ID outback so thank you Pokemon you got it yeah I got it yeah yeah different animals can be photo ID'd in different ways humpback whales it's by the underside of their tail or their flukes and when they go to dive and they're facing away from you that's like the whales fingerprint and if you have a long lens you can actually get a lot of fluke IDs from quite a distance it's a really cool way really hands-off way to be able to study whales without disturbing them you just take advantage of behavior they do all the time but other species of whales like fin whales humpbacks even gray whales you can take a picture of the side of their body with their dorsal hump or their dorsal fin in view and they have a unique modeling pattern down the side of their body and then fin whales have markings and size and shape of the fin can all be identifying marks and gray whales you can identify them by their fluke blue whales you can do their fluke as well but not all of them fluke so it's not always the best tool to use most animals can be identified that way beat whales side of the body Dolf Rizzo's dolphins killer whales do you want to get the eyepatch the dorsal fin and the saddle patch if you can which means you're getting like six photos per animal which is pretty difficult right and left side yeah ideally ideally they always want left side right side but obvious on a whale-watching boat you know 99% of the captains out there beat up can you get the other side of like whatever dude [Laughter] thank you well any any large whale with a with a foul Kate or hooked dorsal fin you can identify based on the side of the body photo sperm whales they do the fluke that's mom well with right whales it's also the shape of the callosity yeah that's pretty much everything has a special technique and some of you are probably wondering like if so many people participate aren't you just gonna get overrun with the same photos over and over and over again that actually it doesn't matter it they actually like that why because one these animals are constantly aging growing so things shapes of things are gonna change you know size of things are gonna change also and also some of those markings you see aren't natural pigments some of them are bite marks from maybe you know a seal on or seal or from a you know a pod mater or another you know conspecific so you just never know who or when something's gonna happen to these animals it might change your appearance so that's why I literally don't mind you know a shot of this animal maybe every day or so or even from a different angle in fact I know a lot of these photo ID systems are now automated using AI or algorithms and they are almost they self learned you know they one they kind of want bad pictures sometimes so they can kind of work on and figure them you know doll in their their identification process yeah yeah that's what I was gonna say the more you submit the better the program can that's about finding out who that whale is yep you guys want to know fun fact about an invertebrate I used photo ID for what you can identify sea stars by the like those calcium build ups they have on there like ochre sea stars oh yeah I've studied 30 sea stars for like eight weeks and I photo ID'd them and documented them every week when I said that oh it's so they're in no that'd be way too hard they move around too much yeah you know you know you'll be like hey will they still be there when I get any of the Dolphins that have positive 100 up to a thousand yeah or thousands so I mean technically you could but it's really hard you technically could and you probably will eventually run into them I mean for example look at like our albino you know Rizzo you know our Casper buddy we see him over and over again down Southern California patches Shores I see him over and over and again not that I mean all that are cool but like patches it's really cool that we can see that pot again yeah yeah they sometimes called those herd indicators so when there's one really an unique looking one it always associates with the some sort of similar social group and so you know that group is coming through the area at a certain interval and that can kind of help you figure out like where did these dogs just move around throughout the year yeah patches has been seen in Mexico I don't know how far down but any years it's been seen in San Francisco or up this way somewhere pretty sure yeah oh wow probably pretty far offshore yeah I'm pretty sure yeah I could be wrong he's offshore Bono's yeah yeah yeah so you'll be surprised what animals can be ID'd out there yeah Caitlin's just talking about the ochre stars even our pinnipeds I know there's a lot of our benefit researchers are actually taking a pictures of the animals you know face and trying to get a photo of their vibrissae that's a big word for whiskers and they're actually set on there their muzzle area in different you know and patterns so you can actually get a photo of that and you know and you know figure out where the whiskers are situated and then you know take a picture of another animal and just kind of catalog them so we've learned that a few years ago we kind of tried this technique me and Kate there was a stellar sea lion that kept on showing up in the front of Moss Landing or wondering if he was the one from last year and I told her about that technique and she looked at her old photos like you know what it is the same one yeah so just looking at the pattern of the vibrissae on their their muzzle area will kind of tell you who they are do you know what is another tip for photographing whales and dolphins alright picking the right day to go on the boat yes and you can do this by calling down and checking with the office but you can also do this by checking the weather on NOAA or I don't know anyone's out of the country or apps yeah look at the wind and so it looks like it's gonna be as well as close to the same wave height as the thermal it is it's it's gonna be choppy at least when it's in feet when it's in meters it's a little different and then if it's gonna be like 15 plus knots then it's gonna be pretty breezy out there well usually if it's yeah I really just depends on where you're going well watching at 2 you should always check if you've never been to that area because it could be different from area to area like we always like to say in the summertime you know come on the morning trip because the wind usually picks up in the afternoon but on the East Coast it could be the opposite so yeah just make sure you check with the whale watch company at least a couple and they know at least two days in advance to whether they should be getting some sort of report yeah it could change it could keep getting pushed forward but definitely check in with the weather it's kind of hard to take photos if you are feeling seasick so definitely be prepared in advance if you're worried about motion sickness at all it's kind of hard to focus through the lens because you lose sight of the horizon when you're shooting and looking through the viewfinder and so it can kind of sneak up on you if you're looking through binoculars or you're using your camera a lot or your phone not using your phone it can really get you kind of disoriented if you don't take a break and you know get reoriented can I recommend medication I mean I might be no but definitely try to take something that's non-drowsy but you're gonna take the medicine you have to take it in advance there's no like instant acting medicine some people use like ginger or they use those acupressure bands those patches but not the bottle nose the ones that go behind your ears I just confused everyone [Laughter] [Music] creating a you already upon the pun on podcast I was gonna be my way of making a living while watching you know warm hydrated you've got snacks cuz it's gonna be more fun for you to be out on deck and get the photos and videos you want if you're feeling good on the boat so it also yeah it depends on where you're at to like I think guys like me and slider grew up down south we literally 24/7 365 days a year our well lodging boats could wear sandals or the t-shirt where's yours yeah Central College I was a life you read somebody you read something too frequently logic companies sites out here and they'll tell people dress like it's snowing and then people go you're crazy you know we're just going out in central California going well watching no and then they come here one morning get out of the boat stand up their bad way okay you're right yeah can we fix that air conditioner No Monterey is always like it's I swear it it's cold in the winter and then it's cold in the summer and then guess what it's cold from the winter again and fall and spring okay but now people now people on like Iowa are making fun of us like dude it's been negative for like a month oh my only that's working is my ears I can only hear your podcast I think how it works where layers the weather what to bring what to wear we can't cannot bring on the boat things like that I think I brought this up in one of our previous podcast about like you know traveling and stuff like that if you are gonna travel a great distance you know to Monterey to come by watching try your hardest and if you can afford it don't do just one trip you know maybe do we have one buddy who came Mia who did like a trip with feel every company out here yes read it out different days different times because as Slater said earlier just get yeah it really is hard for me to break news to people about not going because of weather and then they're like we're only here for today and we came only for this yeah we hear that a lot in office I wish you would have planned three days in a row because what if two days the water you know that's when I plan a trip I always try all right stop stop stop stop stop stop talking about the weather you guys are going to change my trips and sometimes the trips are always different so maybe you see something one day that you didn't see the next day I mean how many trips have you guys been on where you go out and you see humpbacks and dolphins and in a next trip it's like only you only see that way you see how back VC blue whales and you know something else fin whales or something so yeah I've invited so many people out and they're like they want to see killer whales of course and then they go in the morning one and I tell them to go in the morning one because of weather's gonna be better and they believe and then I stay and then we see killer whales so it's like you'll have passengers ask you to like what's your best trip ever Tomek you know what I say that I had the best trip ever once a month because there's always some trip yeah yeah I think amazing happens you know I don't want to get better and better but there's always something good that's gonna happen to you if you guys go out you know as much as you can yeah for sure earlier you guys were kind of talking about the the distance guidelines so for being prepared for your camera lens length so well watch boats in most places around the world do have some sort of regulation or guideline for distance and what you can and cannot do so in the US it's a guideline of a hundred yards that's not a hard and fast rule that's a distance you're supposed to attempt to maintain but the hard and fast rule is you can't alter the whales behavior so if you're 200 yards away and then the whale I'll sudden changes its behavior then that's too close but if you're 50 yards away and the whale is still taking a nap next to you technically you're not breaking the rule so it's kind of tricky up for interpretation different kinds have different things and certain species have extra regulations but that's not the southern resident killer whales is one of the species that has a different regulation and it's in different in up in the San Juans I mean there's different regulations just in one area by the lighthouse you know at the front of San Juan Islands and Limekiln State Park and then around the corner it's completely different than that regulation so yeah there's depending on the species there's a lot of different regulations they're gonna be breaching like the Pacific Life commercial or they're gonna be looking at you eye to eye in the boat you know just they're wild animals and we're trying to you know have them do their normal behaviors and if that means taking a nap for an hour and it's not that exciting to you well if a whales comfortable enough to take a nap next to you for an hour I think you're doing whale watching right yeah exactly you're right now what I'm gonna do that's like we can if you do you're gonna freak out the well it's gonna show off how long I can die for it or it's gonna take off you know so staying back watching a little bit normally is a good thing you know you freak it out it's not exactly a good thing you know there's some captives out there or especially you know who really really do the animal as well I think one of my pet peeves is especially with gray whales you know green ones like to go to the shallow for safety sometimes there's some people who will get in between the whale at the shoreline and that's not good Oh sometimes Wiggum out a little so a lot more experienced guys will actually stay outside the whale so it knows it has that look shallow area I'll probably feel a little more comfortable to run to it but needed to so a lot of your better captains are going to make the experience for you you know make the experience as good as possible for you by respecting the animals the better you behave around the whales the better encounter you have there's so many times where we're just like chillin you know back aways and then it turns comes right to the boat rubs on the bow for like an hour and then you start and then it leave for a second you start to drive away and then you see it turn right back towards you so you shut shut down again and it rubs up you know so yeah the better you behave around the animals the better they'd be the biggest creatures on the planet you do not need to be three feet away from literally going to use the boat scratching post I feel like photographing whales and just watching whales like they're very similar in the fact that you just have to be patient and you know spend lots of time doing it and treat the animals with good behavior and then hopefully they'll reciprocate that like even watching a competitive grouper or a hunt it's like everything seems like it's in slow motion but it's like the whole concept of how the ocean works it's just a different speed than what we're used to we get this question a lot too it's kind of a funny question too but we have where the whales aren't yet yes or what's the famous ones recently with Tommy whales a lot of boats use what's called the clock system to spot whale so the front of the boats 12 o'clock the back is 6 o'clock it gets like the middle of the boats the middle of the clock like an old school watch for those of you that used to wear those still do baby thanks for making a bunch of people feel old I don't think it's I don't think it really has to do with the face of the clock I think these people think that it's literally already well time know it's like a dolphin show like it's gonna be a 12:30 and there's people who think that these animals are wild and free well actually what do you feed a asked Caitlyn on our I don't know one of her first all day trips like last April no - April's ago and I said I said to the whales breach at night because it was still dark when we were leaving and it was like just getting the gray light in this gray are this humpback breach like 10 times in a row and it was like you could even see you can forget to see him like or at least my eye we could see him perfect but you know the camera could not see him yeah we don't know I always say there are safety and orientation talks in the morning it's every passenger on the boat the steps on the boat is about the coming Explorer you're looking for wild animals no clue where they are you know even though they were there 10 minutes ago doesn't mean they're still going to be there that's because they were there yesterday it doesn't mean they're gonna still be there so yeah think of it that way guys every time you step on board that boat you're gonna explore and you're gonna be exploring with us so we are going to be looking for these animals for you yeah it's cool there's not there's not like a a whole bunch of technology that goes into finding the whales every day I mean we use charts and you know flag locations where we've seen well we have some areas that we know where the food's probably gonna be depending on the time of year the migration but like there's no it's still very old-school like it's just get out there pick a course that you think is gonna work out and just look people actually OD have radar sonar for the finding the whales like no we just have really good eyesight yeah radar to put plain simple radar will find things that stay on the surface for you know a length of time so for example a boat or a structure like a breakwater or pier sonar most of our boats have sonar and usually just like a recreational grade stuff that is basically a fish finder and looks below us yeah we can promisee a whale below us but if it's right below you you should have saw it a long time ago but we do see with that sonar its depth contour of the seafloor which sometimes does help us know where food aggregates for these animals and the animals foods such as krill squid friends do know that stronger sonar does actually that's a good question I should answer that a lot of people always ask me do you put the drone up to look for the whales actually we I don't put the drone up to look for the whales I only put their own up one when the conditions allow it or in the right areas and also once we've already found the animals and because if I were to put it up and look for it I would really just be flying around looking at water so it's easier but once we found the whale it's easier to keep track of the whale while they're on a breathing cycle so when they're up you know near the surface and then once they dive down past like 50 feet I lose them so yeah it's really just it's easy to keep track of them once we have them but we can't use that tool to find them it would be nice though it really depends on like the wind and how much you're flying around you can get anywhere from 15 up to like 25 minutes so yeah I mean even some of the drones are even longer honestly and it could go even faster I mean if you have it in like sport mode and you're going 25 40 miles an hour I get so stressed out oh my gosh we like because they're you know fin whales like ten minutes it's down for easily or blue well they go if they're not being you know coming to the surface very often you could put one battery up get two breasts with it and then waste a whole battery yeah so that's another reason why I try to put it up usually right on the first breath that we see it and then I'll leave it up for as many sequences I can get out of the whale yeah all right well I think that's maybe we can save some of the rest of the questions for our next episode yeah what do you think Eric you got any more questions you want to answer all right well you know what you guys thank you so much for listening if you made it this far appreciate all the comments and feedback and we'll try to answer more of these questions in the next episode and hope you guys enjoyed this podcast make sure to follow us on the Instagram it'swell nerds and yeah have a great day thank you all right thanks for listening guys

hello everyone and welcome back to the well nurse podcast this is episode 10 below here with Eric and Caitlyn hello everyone hello my name is Slater and we had a couple fun exciting things that we did over the week I know Caitlyn and I went to a walrus talk and Eric went to a movie are showing on Rizzo's dolphins that's correct well do Eric first because I don't know because we want to hear about it yeah because we already we already know what we saw all right yeah so I actually went to a showing of the documentary called scars and it's actually about some work a researcher did in the Azores with Rizzo's dolphins and the cool thing about this documentary is I think it's a simple enough where someone not even in summary mammals can sit there and really enjoy it because it talks mainly about the social structure about these animals and we learned some pretty fascinating facts during this documentary one thing to make clear is a lot of the facts that they stated in scars is based on the Rizzo's dolphins they see around the Azores they're there year-round and they think that possibly you know that the social interactions they see might possibly only exist with that population of animals because one we don't know that much about Rizzo's that's why the person actually did this documentary and started researching Rizzo's dolphins in that area so one of the few fun facts I know from walk - documentary they're awfully they're pretty long lib they're pretty slow growing I dunno I want to say the moms actually have the calves next to him for you know a few years where some animals this is about a year or so with a with a Rizzo's dolphins I believe it could be I want to recall she said maybe up to about four years or so and you know they start developing that kind of Rizzo looking pigment usually about two years is when they really start getting those scars and that white pigmentation everywhere also they showed like a lot of type of interactions that we see out here but we really didn't know what they what they're all about such as animals coming up synchronised sometimes you know in a pair obviously or sometimes even four or three of them together so that kind of shows like a little bit of a type of interaction that they can do kind of like hey here my buddy let's do some synchronized swimming together also they do a lot of kind of a belly-up type of swimming I believe that was a sign of some dominance also and also another fun fact they do believe that the more white the lighter colored Rizzo's are usually the males the darker are the females so they also show I was laughing I was actually sitting next to our buddy Chelsea over there and they showed a lot of mating footage and I kid you not it went on for about fifteen minutes I was like this is kind of inappropriate fascinating yeah so yeah we all know that you know dolphins are sexual wiser sometimes pretty you know rough but oh yeah they showed me you know one poor little female with you know probably a dozen males just going after her for extended amount of time so a lot of good footage without a drone underwater footage and once again they don't know much about Rizzo's that's why they do believe that some of the behaviors they saw over there might exclusively really be you know that population that culture you know over there so our Monterey rezo's might not act the same way it's funny because yesterday I saw a bigger pot of resist you know how we normally see like you know 15 or 20 mmm well yesterday we had a pot of easily over 150 together and they were spyhopping which was I mean like a full-on spy hop you know straight out of the water and slowly sink back down which was really cool they were breaching all over the place and then one of them was on their back for like almost three minutes just you know kind of peck slapping exactly like doing the back so that is the thumbnail for this one yeah but yes what did they say that that might be a sign of dominance from the hills just call you because I called Caitlin I was like this this R is sp weird she's like yeah they think that means very quickly guys the the documentary is called scars and the woman who made it and all the you know all the paper papers were written by her her name is Karen Louise Hartman maybe go online you'll find numerous publications from her about the sociology and you know and the ecology of these animals and yeah I'm not sure if this documentary is available anywhere you know to the general public yet we got lucky enough that ACS Los Angeles was presenting it so never know might come to your city soon hopefully I want to see it yeah it was great guys yeah I think Slater you actually would enjoy because of the it was really neat you know a lot of a lot of drone footage also some underwater stuff and yeah pretty unique unique film something that he was talking about the staying with their mother for longer than two years we're not walrus talked at Caitlyn and I were at yesterday they were saying two years as well right and then belugas we're staying pretty long yeah so certain odontocetes they have a longer lactation period for the calf and so like like we know that with killer whales like the calves stay with mom and could be nursing off and on for in the wild could be four or five maybe even more years and like bottlenose dolphin tend to keep a calf with them for two years and the calf will be nursing still for that whole time but some species of dolphins or harbor porpoise is actually what her best comparison was harbor porpoise they're weaned after a year so lactation and maternal care is pretty short and then like bottlenose dolphins could be two years or more wow that's interesting so basically most of the Donna seeds have a two-year or maybe more yack tation period yeah yeah I would say so and then that kind of led her into talking about the two different methods of like maternal care in marine ma'am well in Alma in all animals so there's income breeders and there's capital breeders the income breeders and this is in regards to like lactation and foraging so the income breeder does not store a lot of fat on its body like the sea otter and so it has to constantly eat while caring for young and nursing the capital breeder on the other end of the spectrum the most extreme is like elephant seals or even I think would del seals fall into this as well they only they will stay on the beach the entire time they're lactating and not forage at all and once though so like elephant seals only nurse for like 30 days and then that's it they the pup is on its own and what's crazy is it when she said that then she said that then the calf is just on their own sitting on my beach for another 30 days or 60 days yeah and then they go out to feed on their I'll learn to feed on their yeah so the elephant seals like so they get weaned at a month old and by 3 months old they've like basically exhausted all of their blubber store and so they have to go out and learn how to eat and what was the reason why they like to stay fast for those minimum about a month was a reason it just sit for them it makes more sense because they're the body size and an ability to forage enough to stock up that much fat that that's just the the most efficient method is to just be on the beach that seems really short like okay I have a baby it's three months old piece and then it's like peace yeah figure it out yeah I'm gonna leave yeah and that's actually Dan Costa talked about that and when he did it elephant seal talked a couple months ago for ACS Monterey as well he kind of they're trying to figure out now how much is nature versus nurture as far as how do they learn stuff because yeah they get ditched after 30 days on the beach is there like adults just kind of like waiting around show them what to do or they just somehow our program to know how to find food on assume it's like some sort of instinct to where to go but then maybe once they're in that area they see what other ones are doing yeah it's really weird with mammals is like some just show like straight-out instinct to you know do things but then you got animal like you know another mammal sea otters where they pretty much learned they have to learn everything from mom you know like larly you know how to how to groom themselves how food preferences breaking up into food you know so yeah it's kind of weird how some can literally just like pop out mom go see ya and then you got you know sea otters that like mom you need to teach me everything so our penguins income breeders or their capital breeders because the mom they're not you know it's not lactating but they have to go all the way to the ocean find fish and then come back and trade over the other or the dad is going into the ocean getting fish coming back they kind of fall in know their I mean they it falls in the middle so because while we're so the same way right there in in between income and capital breeders is what we ended up finding out they do store up some fat to then nurse with milk but then that's after about it looked like about 200 days they have to go out and start foraging they're out of blubber reserves so penguins it's like they stock up and then they come feed the chick and then they trade off so they they kind of fall in between but then they have two parents also caring for the chick where is most of the examples it's only the maternal care that's true yeah so mostly they're talking about lactating mammals and then a lot of the times for marine mammals especially it's only maternal care yeah cuz I mean I understand that the penguins aren't lactating but they're still having that you know Thank You vestment yeah yeah and they stock up on their on their fat layers too for for holding out and keeping the chick warm during them turning the cold cold breeding season yeah penguins are pretty pretty good with that even an individual penguin I know for example I think maybe most penguins do that but focusing on penguins that I remember working with megalonyx I know they do a thing where if they're gonna molt they know they can't go into the water because they don't have that federal layer so load up on food you know plump themselves up you know so they're they're really bright when it comes to budgeting their you know nutrition do you recall how many calories a day that walrus eats okay 27,000 so the original estimate that dr. Noren came up with because here's the problem with working with species that are kind of in inaccessible areas is you have to try and make a model and you may have never seen the animal before so dr. Nord had never seen a walrus when she was trying to do this calculation and so she estimated that a two-year-old so a newly weaned walrus needs 37,000 kilocalories a day how many 37,000 Wow which was how many clams well they eat eight clams per minute and she assumed they'd forage like I didn't get it all written down 50% of the time yeah hours yeah 12 hours of foraging it was but then her original estimate was that then a female that's pregnant and still nursing her first calf would need like a hundred and twenty seven thousand calories a day but that would mean that she's foraging for 24 and a half hours a day yeah and that doesn't work so what she figured out after working with walruses in captivity and getting some more observations from past pregnant walruses where they sampled the blood of the walrus every week in a captive situation she was able to figure out that they stock up when they're about to give birth to a calf and so they can then budget themselves to be able to sustain an eighty thousand calorie per day energy demand so they use some of their blubber but then also will forage while nursing a pups and sometimes the the nursing period is two years so sometimes she's pregnant with the next one while still nursing yeah the first one that's nuts to me so something that's a problem for these walruses is the ice is obviously melting in the Arctic and they're having to travel further to get food because he / yeah or go deeper to get food and so they're trying to figure out if it's going to be possible for them to be on land and then traveling out 120 miles to go feed on this food yeah some so that's the other thing she was trying to calculate there their energy budget for the day because that's assuming that they're only like actively swimming for 80 percent of the day but then if there's less ice and they're having to travel further between foraging areas and haul out sites then that means they're gonna be swimming almost all day and so then that affects how much more energy they need to be able to sustain their daily activities that is crazy I think life to live one of the coolest facts about how she was figuring out the like energy demands for a pregnant female is that they were able to estimate that a female gains four hundred pounds in fat during pregnancy to prepare for lactation while on the breeding ground and then it was like with the baby inside her it was like what was it it was almost it was a 600 then yeah because the placenta plus the baby way yeah a couple hundred pounds yeah it was crazy and interestingly walrus are actually not currently listed on the endangered species list and the 2017 report that went out for consideration actually wasn't very well written so it didn't it didn't make a compelling argument to put them on the list and so it's being reworked to try and better capture the issues that they're having and I didn't know this but USGS of the US Geological Service survey service is actually responsible for never even heard of that until yesterday yeah so yes yes is responsible for sea otters polar bears and walrus and NOAA is responsible for all the other marine mammals I didn't realize that no they weren't under NOAA's purview Noah is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration they also oversee the National Marine Fisheries Service within their jurisdiction but USGS is its own entity outside of that I had no idea that that those animals fell under their purview and it is important to the Arctic habitat to kind of figure out what's going on with walrus and they are important to the ecosystem because just like our local sea otters in Monterey walrus are keystone species to the benthic habitats near shore for the Arctic so when they dig with their tusks in the sediment on the bottom the troughs they leave behind actually have higher species diversity of invertebrates right in the trough compared to sites directly next to the trough because they're stirring up the sediment and so that that creates a different like perturbance in the ecosystem and it actually ends up being a good thing I still can't believe it animal that big eats clams well the primary food that's their primary food within there's other invertebrates or invertebrates like sea stars and little things like yea sea stars that what she said not disgusting she said things that are in the mud just like the great whales I think yeah I mean I say that and then in the same breath also realize like whales eat the tiniest things too but it's like the walrus never might suck the clams but didn't think about like the manatees you know they just did grass in the bottom right yeah yeah but they're not as big as a walrus and walrus is also like walk around on land and stuff - where's manatees I feel like I'm more adapted to be completely in the water streamlined so that they're just foraging around on sea grass and whatever but yeah those manatees are really picky - they only go after certain types of vegetation - grass and a female another another interesting fact is females take 12 years to be at their full-grown body size as far as mass goes so their heaviest once they're 12 years old and they actually also have incredibly high digestive efficiency so even though they eat something very low head that has low calorie value they're really efficient at using all the nutrients in digestion I'm just pretty cool and that was a lot of great stuff that walruses and there is about both of those yeah a lot of stuff I didn't know yeah for sure it was interesting I didn't that's also ACS's first time having someone talk about Wohlers so that was pretty cool yeah do you guys want to go back on since we skipped some questions on episode 9 or didn't skip them but we didn't get to them do you guys want to go through some of these questions I have up here and go through some of that stuff yeah go for it all right let's go with this first one what are some cool and interesting interactions you guys have seen between cetaceans and other animals like humpbacks accidentally swallowing birds or things like that I've actually seen oh yeah you actually just show the video of sea lions yeah pretty much bouncing off of humpback whales hands and stuff like that I haven't personally seen one in the mouth but there's a few there yeah and our fleet that actually showed sea lions swimming out of the mouth of a humpback and even a pellet I think Kate yeah actually got that photo of that Pelican yeah getting out of a humpback whales mouth and I've seen him what MERS out before - can you guys explain to them that they can't actually swallow a bird or sea lion down because people are always saying yeah I'm not really gonna eat that's you so our humpback whales as big as they are the you know the the opening where the food goes down I always like to say it's about the size of a grapefruit or softball so and obviously these whales these humpback whales have our baleen whales that got baleen plates so you don't have teeth I can't chew anything up so animals large as a sea lion well actually you know it's impossible for them to actually get it down yeah but believe it or not birds birds like MERS and I think even some creeps have been retrieved out of the feces of hump Rockwell's that's actually been documented up north so most of our large baleen whales you know I didn't know don't even physically have the capability of swallowing something the size of a sea line but oh yeah a bird if the you know bilir not yeah if the well really wanted to they can yeah probably just barely get it down for some I mean I don't think they could swallow a pelican but smaller but I can actually find the yeah yeah there is a paper out there that actually has photos of birds birds that are reach retrieved from the animals feces so smaller birds yeah interesting they could do that well I have seen them let smaller birds out before nothing as small as like a knock lip but I have seen them let a mer out I think lunch feeding on a big school of anchovies and there's a bunch of aqua tumors swimming around in there then I mean it's bound to happen yeah I mean I was amazed that it could even tell that the mer was in there cuz Murs are pretty small but I saw the merge I'm proud of the mouth and I was like huh how did you even know that was in there okay guys so actually found the paper I know I feed my good friends here know I always tell people they don't repeat anything I can't back up with a paper but this paper is called a molecular identification of a seabird remains found in humpback whale feces looks like it was written in 2013 Trevor Haines Matthew Campbell Janet Neilson Andres Lopez but yeah you can see these photos in Alaska have you pull up the paper you actually see the photos of the birds just though about a foot long yeah a person put a ruler they mostly look like they were just past accidents happen through the digestive system not yeah actually well I changed what I've ever told everyone and I guess they can accidentally swallow smaller birds but I definitely don't think they can get a pelican down I would I would assume not I mean yeah they're big we've seen them let pelicans out that's very interesting well I wonder also um so birds like MERS go flightless in the summer after they've gotten the chicks off the nest and so I wonder if that may be a factor too because then there's not so much wingspan and so even if the bird like freaked out and put its wings out it could still get it down because those flight feathers are not on the bird at that time of the year yeah and I mean obviously they can't get away from killer whales or anything else I mean getting away killers is a big different story but yeah they can't fly though I mean like it's can fly and Eric and I watch that pot of killer we'll kick this one awkward around for a hour and it's like just fly but he obviously was too full to fly I mean I'm getting by by it by the time you know he got kicked once or twice he's probably been yeah probably so disoriented so that's another interesting interaction we see killer whales use Birds that are sitting on the surface as target practice I've seen them kick Murs around feeding them chase auklets around well it's have we seen that here well the sea lion humpback whale interaction is something that's becoming more and more popular yeah yeah and that's pretty cool I mean there's some footage I've seen out of Alaska of stellar sea lions doing that with humpback whales but I've never really seen anything else like it anywhere in the world yeah I've only started seeing it the last two hours that I've been here and Eric was with me for one of them I think you've been with me for one but I mean there was one time we were just watching humpbacks feeding and killer whales came right through their area and then another time we had killer whales attacking a sea lion and then humpbacks came in and gone between the two of those going on so I've seen humpbacks herd a raft of sea lions around the other side of our boat when killer whales like killer whales were coming from the starboard side and all these humpbacks and sea lions surfaced right next to the boat on the starboard side and these two humpbacks escorted all the sea lions to the port side of the boat they went across the bow and over to the port side of the boat and it was like I've never seen anything else like it ever again yeah I think that the killer whales and the humpbacks and intervening and it's happening around the world that's what also is so interesting is this increasing phenomenon that's been documented all over the place yeah and what's cool about it is it's not just because of that it's not just you know marine scientists marine biologists looking at these humpback whales now it's you know people say like psychologists and they were neurologists are looking at humpback whales and the way they think there is some talk about the abundance of spindle cells yeah and the brains of our humpback whales spindle cells are usually type of neuron that actually you think it's in part of brain that feels empathy love sympathy I think I've heard people maybe you guys even talking about it that the humpbacks you can hear them coming in an area like they'll trumpet blow you know all sorts of stuff winter predation is going on and I've seen him do it with gray whales in the area as well and they think that maybe the humpbacks are doing it because they know that they're getting attacked their casts get attacked you know where they get attacked in other areas so maybe they're just like they just hate them all together I'm sure they don't like them yeah what you brought is exactly right yeah there's some people thinking it's not just this neighborhood it's just yeah it's just an insane thing like oh you know those guys around so yes interesting that I mean that footage from Antarctica were the humpback whales on its back with the sea lion on its belly and it's got its PEC fins up that was in that Pitman paper came out I mean to me that's just that's just unreal the amount of like evasive behavior the humpback whale did on behalf of the seal yeah keep it away from the killer that's one case that you know in my opinion that's that takes some thought process there yeah that's a little bit more that's pretty sophisticated know about other interactions although really quickly guys actually save that paper so any of you guys know me I can forward that to you and keep in mind like I said the humpbacks aren't purposely ingesting these birds they just happen to get in there so we might be able to find a way on the pod beam site yeah if I start citing that like you know yeah upload it as a PDF if not we can put the the URL yeah just put the yeah I even have a brief little list of papers that yeah that that Karen lady wrote that's just amazing like I said she has just dozens of papers out there were really good facts about these animals and their social interactions we see so much out here it's hard to pinpoint I mean humpbacks and sea lions is a cool interaction itself we I think we don't know if we talked about that in other episodes or maybe actually I think we talked about how you can look for the sea lions Oh coming up in there and there's a strictly cetaceans cetaceans of other animals that oftentimes I think a lot of people just don't even realize that this is an inter species interaction oftentimes when you have a big pot of dolphins especially if they're foraging there are sea lions in there too mm-hmm and so that's a pinniped tagging along with an Adonis eat okay I know funny interaction whenever you see Pacific white-sided dolphins in Southern California there is always one seal and I swear that's funny and it's you know there's not very many whites yeah small I think we're usually getting the ones we see in Southern California let's talk that we're seeing a lot of the pods that frequent Baja and that's why it's more seasonal for us seem like it as morsi's little bit more well yeah I swear there's always a seal hanging with the dolphins but that's not a weird interaction like that happens here almost every day yeah yeah but yeah we're down there it's funny there's kind of thing I think I've talked about this in another episode um I'm weird we were talking about elephant seals I think but I had seen one time I went down to the boat and slipped next to ours was empty and a juvenile elephant seal and a juvenile harbor seal we're just like following each other around the harbor when they're on the beach they seem pretty standoffish with each other but these two are just like hanging out you know our date was really cute just seeing that many times which is weird now you bring it up it might be I don't know why those two well sometimes boobie cheddar I mean we've seen it right there at Hopkins I've seen it even then over there up here this Blancas you know I've seen a harbor seal pop up in the Rookery yeah there's probably cruising the coast and I'll check out these things you know but then when those big males come up on the beach on Hopkins they cause all the harbor seals flush off though they do yeah last time so when I walked by there with my wife and her friend the hell with the big male elephant she was at the very top like right where the green ice plant started he was all the way up and there's 15 or 20 seals at the bottom really some days some days they'll have photos and videos where the males are coming off shore and they're just constant well we once they get up there they know there's a lower on the beach or something yeah and then I actually had an intern a couple years ago who was trying to answer the question of what is the relationship between albatross especially black-footed albatross and killer whales because in the spring we do see I will trust a lot I know you guys saw some the last few days I saw one last week and like 90% of the time when you see killer whales you also see black-footed albatross opposite when you see the yeah and sometimes albatross are good indicators killer whales around yeah so that's another interesting interaction do the albatross actually make an effort to follow the killer whales because they know a high-fat food sources come in their way or is it just coincidence because they smell the oil you know that a student was trying to answer that question a couple summers ago and I don't think he really had enough data to make it very conclusive but it's a very high rate of them being in the same place at the same time have you guys ever seen northern right well dolphins without whites heads I have not personally I've heard you Edward sometime yeah I'm sure it happens I'm just I've never seen northern right whale dolphins without white sides yeah I mean yeah I've seen times I think the time you got really mad at me I was just them for the picture yeah why I'd lose a follower really big herds of northern right well dolphins with only a few white sides but I've never seen one heard of just right well dolphins but I've heard other people I've seen them they uh yesterday we were leaving gray whales to go to a big pot of Pacific white-sided dolphins that another captain said they just like scattered out of nowhere he said there might have been a few northern right whale dolphin so I was like please let's go there but we ended up coming across the humpback that was tail slapping so we didn't get to see the dolphins the only time I've ever seen like a real serious feeding effort where the whales were next to each other that was two different baleen whales was fin whales and humpbacks actually it's probably the only time I've seen fin whales feed with other whales besides occasionally blue whales but these whales were like in echelon together like feeding like together on the same bait ball Williams I would say because you yeah on the all-day trip you were with me when we had the blue fin wasn't humpback yeah but these guys were feeding at the surface unless last summer's they yeah we actually it was we had a blue and humpback legend curl together yeah one shot had both high spirits with you okay cuz Kate was out there one time and we had the same thing humpbacks in blue walls were lunch feeding and over again it was doing these side lunges yeah the blue whale is obviously bigger then there's a parallel to yeah I've seen all three species in the same area feeding on something but like these whales were like information together surface feeding and I've seen fin whales and humpback whales do it I've seen blue whales surface feed near humpback whales but not like in parallel in tandem together it was pretty bad just that's my goal is to get from the drone a blue and a humpback side-by-side lunch video up that day ya know there was a day that I had it was really foggy my yeah I was overcast and I couldn't see the blue agus it was just like the it was too spotty they were they were random it was so random I could yeah I remember a lot of people are out there Ron and Jane on that little private boat where yeah okay so that's exactly yeah yep it was a good day yeah what about have any of you seen well okay you could use either way sea lions eating sharks or sharks eating sea lions always think like Oh sharks eat sea lions which yes is true but sea lions it matters yeah I've seen it go both ways big enough to eat or be eaten I've seen sea lions eat sharks but I have never actually seen a predation of a shark on a sea lion while out on the boat yeah I've been lucky enough to see sea lions I saw sea lion back in Southern California the thresher shark that was amazing I've also seen him go after Smoothhound sharks and spiny dogfish and literally just two months ago I finally saw the other way big white shark go after either a sea lion or a elephant seal just a little bit south of Hanoi boat so seen some some interactions between those animals yeah one that I can think of that I've seen quite often in Southern California is sea lions eating thresher sharks and I don't know I feel like I talked about this on one of the podcasts even the early one that one of the first or second ones but yeah the sea lions like a group of males grabbed three or four dozen sharks all within like ten minutes of each other like really close to each other and they just ya they ate him and it was crazy it was a group of sea lions no it was like once you lion had won another scene I came in and he got his own oh wow also been like a school with dressers down there so yeah so one of them was already being eaten and then then when I got was he brought a fresh one up to service and then he tried to like you know throw it a little bit and then he he slipped and the Drescher swam down and then he brought it back up and then he full-on had it by the gills and just where it ripped the gills right out like interesting and then the thing just like yeah you know I just realized guys would that you mention that it seems like when we see our lunge feeding it's have you know it's like all the sea lines are about the same age and size yeah I'm just wondering if we have some pinniped experts here can like you know do they different age groups you know feed together are the males bigger mature males that I mean more I know they like to be under I know they'd like to be on their own but today hunt alone too you know they feed alone too I think from the drone when I see them I think it's a lot of males in there yeah yeah but they're all also the same size yeah or just looks like that I know certain animals are like that and speaking of sharks like the leopard shark someone realize that leopard sharks when they're in when they're like in schools there's never more than the foot difference in sizes small great whites here and Aptos are the babies that are in by the beach yeah go I don't know enough about threshers but I'm not sure yes sorry the leopard sharks do the leopard sharks grow to a certain size and then leave from the beach or the beach yeah cuz they're all separate room yeah like you know back home they're always in the back further in the Back Bay you know and the harbours and stuff like that so yeah we have the great whites here and they're here because they're juveniles and they're feeding on like the surf I don't know yeah yeah they're going after a surf perched young rockfish they'll go after raised the small flatfish in the surf line yeah and then they'll move slowly offshore as they get bigger yeah like I said in the last episode that the dentition starts changing about eleven feet or so you know broader teeth more serrations and you get that body weight where it can go after the bigger bigger animals yeah I was going to say they also can therm a little better because they're bigger in size they don't have to stay tied to that little pocket of warm water anymore you know what's something that's kind of cool the jelly fish blooms that we have here I don't know about them happy I know they happen in other areas but this is a four I mean I've seen them you know Southern California like randomly you see a couple of moon jellies or like a random purple jelly shows up but really here in Monterey you get those big huge blooms of the nettles the purple stripe jellies or the moon jelly yeah sometimes you get big blooms of cross jellies too small yeah that's kind of a cool so it's not between two species but it's a cool interaction well sometimes we see mola mola feeding on them oh yeah I like it when they miss does that mean like I think it's so funny when they miss and they realize and they have to like do a hairpin turn all right guys so pretty much at the end of every episode we always ask you guys to ask us questions or topics that you were like brought up and one of our listeners Antonio Thank You Antonia asked a pretty good question he wants to know in general these animals you know cetaceans migration routes patterns how they learned them and stuff like that and in general so most of our cetaceans do migrate a lot of them will spend time in a feeding ground or in a breeding ground and they usually spend more time in their feeding grounds than their breeding grounds that's for most species and what happens is some people like to ask the question how do they know where the go you know is it just instinct we believe yes sometimes it is just instinct we also in some cases think that some of our cetaceans out there are kinda like what I mentioned about otters earlier are probably learned it from that mother a parent actually taught them that exact migration route we also think that some of these animals are mammals and even other animals that are might have the ability to sense you know electromagnetic fields obviously we're mammals - if you talk to an anthropologist they say humans you know we rely so much on maps and other things that we've lost that ability there's some cultures out there for example there is one island out in the South Pacific where there's people out there who don't have the technology we have they refer to directions as Northwest each South they you know still have that instinct to kind of just feel what direction is which so if you continue using it you know you didn't probably you know find your way or feel your way around these people don't say right or left they say east or west you know or whatever direction so like I looked that up - I forgot which island it was but these people are really good navigators - because of that but we have a feeling that some of our animals can sense that we know that with for example like this is not a cetacean but leatherback sea turtles have a gland on top of their head pineal if I might be saying it wrong pineal or a pineal gland that actually when light sunlight touches it will actually kind of kind of make it produce a hormone that causes hey I need to go here I need to go there so there might be numerous ways these animals are triggered to move during also still might be numerous ways they know where to go so every species a little bit different a lot of us like to talk about gray whales when it comes to migrations after they have one of the greatest migrations that have all animals out there we do think that Caitlyn might be able to touch more this since she worked with one of the gods of gray whales out there but we do think that gray whales probably learn from mom or even it might be semi visual I noticed especially we brought this up many times there in this episode that's where she has californians heavy nose everywhere that's called a point is usually a good spot to see a gray whale you know today you know look for these points is that why they you know preach or spy hop at times we just don't know so might be numerous ways certain whales are are figuring out where to go and when to go to places yeah I think especially for gray whales because they're such a coastal navigator I some of it sound to they carrying the waves crashing on the shoreline hey you guys always say that I see they really think they can hear the waves that well yeah you hear everything and then there's other work that's been done around Monterey Bay where they were I think it was Monterey Bay it's somewhere where there was a deep water crossing just not too far ahead and they were recording the vocalizations of great well mom and calf pairs and they were vocalizing quite a bit and then they got to the point to cross over the deep water and they stopped vocalizing and so there's there's definitely some there's got to be a maternal component of like okay we have to be quiet until we get to the next safe spot like we're talking now but then like it's complete silence once you get over the deep water and that's to avoid detection by predators so there may be some teaching and there may be also some like okay when we're going down you got to keep it on the left when we're going up you got to keep it on the right a lot of how you doing yeah a lot of a you know a lot of us who are a lot of you listeners are probably you know obviously this thing because you're into bio but hormones you know are triggered by certain environmental signals you know the length of day the daylight you know obviously that triggers these animals you know to go okay hey it's that time yeah there's numerous things out there that could trigger the start of these migrations could even be temperature you know yeah they say the the prevalence of ice the daylight and the temperature is what triggers great whales to start their migration and on years where the ice takes a long time to build the gray whales are usually late for migration because they've gotten so far north feeding what is it like the leatherback turtles you know they're born on land they have some land on the MA eggs and they know to go towards the beach I mean that's instinct right the exact beach that they were born at Scot Benton gave a talk a couple years ago about leatherbacks and when they when they hatch they're so small that they're basically plankton they can't swim against the current so wherever the current pushes them they develop this they like lay down this chemical signature of that route and that's the route they will always take the rest of their life to get to wherever they food and then back to their home Beach yeah no they're back Turtles really do interest me oh yeah I would love to go see them when they hatch you know cuz it's crazy I mean how many feet back off the shore do you think it is have you ever been to an area where the hatch no area yeah I don't know but I'm pretty sure I heard that it's a decent amount of like it's quite a ways up to space and they got an you know you know I really think something I can document here I don't know what it was in but about the moon like they knew which way to go towards the the moonlight or something cuz we're going at night too yeah some some turtle nesting areas like in Florida when I went down to Sanibel Island they actually asked the residents to turn off all of the municipal lights and all their house lights when it's turtle nesting season so that the turtles will go towards the water because they're following the moonlight and lights on they'll go towards the street yeah yeah light makes a big difference this is not really having to do migration but yes and temperature is also really important there's numerous factors at what beach day they show up at but letter backs yeah it's amazing that you ever looked at a picture of a letter back the back of their head you'll see that little pink spot that pink spot they believe it's kind of like a window for you know light to kind of figure out yes exposed to that you know this is somebody exposed to that gland that's under there also another cool thing about that pink spot is it's always a different shape so it's also used for ID purposes too of individuals out there sorry well those are those leatherbacks though from me and Eric saw because we're pretty cool like that whatever you guys we saw so many quiet wait so they migrated from I mean here off the west coast all the way to nowhere is really far Indonesia I mean is there another population two of them are getting coast yeah there's there's numerous ones you know that we got some believe it not our population is not doing too hot the female account is very low the reason why I say female account because think about folks male sea turtles it's very very very very very very very rare that they come to shore you only see that in the Hawaiian Islands most other sea turtles the male's never come to shore so when you're counting Turtles on land it's most like this you know anywhere other than Hawaii it's good to be female usually so the female counts are really low that population that nest in the Florida believe it or not is doing I don't want say very good but decent yeah but this leads us actually to another good saying that we should probably bring up we're talking about migrations and you know just because an animal migrates one way it doesn't mean its counterparts could be doing the same don't forget that some of our animals at different populations they're going to go to different directions at times humpbacks are you know perfect perfect animal to bring up 14 different populations all with different places that they're going to feed and also breed at different distances to cover you know what I like to say on the boat which I think makes people's brains hurt a little bit is even though whales are always moving from a cold water area to a warm water area that's their you know they're going from high latitude to low latitude for feeding and breeding all of the whales regardless of the hemisphere I'm moving north and south at the same time because the southern hemisphere whales are up near the equator so they've gone north while our whales are returning to the feeding ground yeah yeah and people are like wait what I'm like yeah think about it I mean they're going for opposite purposes but they're traveling north and south the globe at the same time yeah that's pretty interesting just go for my breeding ground to breeding ground our feeding ground a few actually Costa Rica they say they have whales pretty much all year because the two different ends of the globe have breeding grounds there yeah that's pretty nice oh yeah these migration patterns are always varying between the different populations out there we've there's there's a few extreme cases where some of these animals have found a company spot and actually sometimes won't move me and Kaitlyn just read that one paper about the Pacific coast feeding group gray whales that actually have one member debt what state of Oregon they're watching the entire that's plenty of food well we had humpbacks do that in Monterey Bay the winter of 2014 going into 15 we we saw more humpbacks and gray whales a lot of days what are the younger ones are there's some bigger ones maybe yeah that year there was quite a few young ones but there were some full-grown adults that stayed there was like 25 or 30 humpbacks in the bay all winter in my first year 2016 our 17 17 16 16 yeah I mean we had a November December we had I'm pretty good into the winter but then they left yeah they were they made it pretty far in the winter and there was a couple around there was no feeding on the beach late like yeah and now one of our suits are pregnant too and I was like at one point I was like this whale needs to leave because it did a tail so at one point we're like oh that whales for sure pregnant also why are you still here like you gotta go yeah and another thing that's kind of a generalization but kind of accurate and good one is these whales will usually feed in a cooler area cooler areas tend to be more biologically active there's a number of factors that are because of that cooler water tends that more dissolved oxygen at times and because of that life just kind of really flourishes you know your plankton is obviously gonna be nice and healthy your plankton could be feeding bigger food sources like curl here anchovies so that's obviously whale food so cooler water tends to be areas where these whales feed warmer is also a good place to give birth and there's also reasons why that is good - because your calf has usually could be young and skinny so being born in warmth is obviously gonna be a lot more comfortable yeah there's also so Jim sue mentioned I talked about this we talked about this quite a bit almost every time I see him weight geek Alba geeked out about this so culture in Wales I think plays a big component into your established migration destination for the breeding ground right so with gray whales we see a lot of calves born on the southbound journey now the environment is more favorable temperature-wise for a calf to be born pretty much anywhere once you get south of Washington I think the water is tolerable enough temperature-wise that the calf can survive however that didn't used to be the case so used to be ice all the way down the coast there during the last glacial maximum which gray whales lived through because they've been on this earth for a long long time so of course you're like dang we got to get all the way as far south as we can get where it's warm because we're gonna freeze our our tails off so then you also think about the storm surge and the effective swells on a whale that doesn't is not strong at swimming so even though they could have a calf in Monterey Bay and probably just hang out here all winter the swells when we get like 20 to 30-foot waves breaking at point-p nose and a calf that doesn't know how to swim that's gonna be a lot of work for the mom to keep the calf up at the surface so that's another motivation to be in that shallow water Lagoon because you're not subject to that kind of wave action yeah now you think that now that you mentioned that you look at that books Pacific Coast feeding group I mean that probably wasn't just lazy whales that was smart whales going you know what there's food down here and why am I going to go to go past that rougher area and maybe more you know there might even be more predators up there do you mean think about we all watch like Deadliest Catch you know we all know going through that straight right there yeah going through that straight right there it's it's rough water you know and you can take York after that if they get up to the Chukchi you know yeah maybe that's why so predators have stayed down predator aversion it's the effects of the wave action and the temperature kind of olive compounded but it's also like this cultural agreement of like for tens of thousands of years we've been going to this spot we all agree on this I checked my old notes in fact I told Slayer and we were almost like like what I think it was like two years ago at the certain California Marine Mammal workshop I think Dave Weller said that possibly up to 35% of gray whale calves are being picked off right there through the Bering Strait pretty big yeah exactly so it's like why go through there there's plenty of food back there it's calmer a little warmer let's stay you know towards Vancouver in Northern California I knew there was a percentage I thought it was like 10 or 15% I was getting picked off but yeah 30 that's a lot yeah I couldn't believe that below this last time when we saw Jim at the Marine Mammal workshop a couple of weeks ago he even was like I don't doubt it if you start seeing gray whales like hanging out in Monterey Bay during breeding season like whoa they're speaking of getting picked off it would be really nice to go watch them get picked off under that I like I think that's great crazy I heard that they sit under ice and wait for them and do something like what is that thang they like the magic what steal steal third base it's like there's a name for it no I don't know Bering Strait I think something passed like it said yes Gary named it that's true let's try a dead gray whale Pass hmm I don't want to see them die I just want to see okay I just wanted to kill oral sex I sleep you know well yeah I mean I feel like you always want to see whales with snow in the background that's like always on your lips I don't know is it your new Mac pass doesn't evil no no it's not it's like something ominous yeah I don't know but I'm just a nice messages yeah Slater always wants to see whales with ice in the background so if you can help him out with that you know what this humpback breeds just high enough when I was in Iceland that you could get like a snowy gray well flukes with like what is it what are the now is behind Orange County I can't do saddle bag yes yeah I got yeah just put that old picture of all shorts in salad back it's like yeah they do show up in Orange County yeah it's funny cuz people like mark Gerardo I've got a picture of like the ticket picture of the Newport Pier with the snow in the background yeah yeah why are you photoshopping the snow in the background is like no it actually says favorite worry ever yeah alright so yeah that was a great question on the migrations and populations that we can go so many go off on so many other subjects so we got that router yeah interesting stuff to use a lot of it we don't we still don't know because they use so much offshore space yeah I've seen humpback mom and calf pairs more than 100 miles maybe even 200 miles from store I can't remember exactly where especially you know these humpbacks in the Pacific there's they're getting so their populations are getting you know pretty pretty hefty and as what Jhansi said what the Pacific is pretty much their playground yeah more animals obviously they're gonna be more spread out and like some books even safe in whales might shift their breeding location based on prey availability somehow they're able to communicate that to each other and I don't know if that's you know I'm not exactly sure what led them up to that conclusion but they there's no documented real breeding area like blue whales we think they go off the coast of Costa Rica even though we see them in California but fin whales they don't even have a location listed yeah the other day when we were at the conference there's even talk that you know we got fins they're just kind of early but just almost resonant to certain areas right now you know we do know certain fin whales or just frequenting the Southern California area a lot a lot and I'm actually interested in seeing this summer you know when we go a little bit further offshore I mean get some photos of the fin whales we see and see if they're the ones you know also in California yeah I mean we had one year I think it was 2016 in the summer right before Slater got here we had the most fin whales that any of the skipper's and some of them have been driving boats for over 50 years more fin whales and we've ever seen before in my Bay and we also had a lot of krill early in the season but also consistent into the fall and we and we don't really know what happened yeah you know one all day like seven or nine days just traveling upon whales and humpbacks let me go back to who did you hear that right before I got here before you got here with the sperm whale like a month before yeah I mean some nights we had 15 to 20 fin whales and like ten five to ten humpbacks I'm just insane what was it last not this last one - 2017 October we had the like 50 blue whale show up yeah actually through Thanksgiving we saw him through Thanksgiving - mm yeah we had blue whales all every month of the year in 2017 I think almost so that was that was yeah very interesting to have that many whales that late yeah as I always say hey I got a paper for you guys I was just briefly talking Caitlin about the fin whales that kind of stick off Southern California if he realized are interested in looking for that paper a group called a marine ecology and telemetry research they actually released a poster paper also on those spin wheels are frequenting Southern California now we got a lot of listeners from that area so they might be interested to know that yeah you might be seeing the same fin whales over and over again so that famous whale fluky he might be someone that stays around there and it seems like he really does or she because we see that whale almost year after year you know the acs we also had kind of a cool insight into like winter habitat use of bowhead whales from that one talk where they put a hydrophone in an area where they're like oh we don't know if there's bowhead whales here and then they had like continuous bowhead whale song for like months yeah yeah so then they were like wow this is actually a winter habitat for bowhead whales we had no idea because we can never survey here in the winter time and then the hydrophone actually is the reason why they even knew that in what area is this again like somehow people get there like crazy remote you know like paul Nicklin gets there and i was like yeah this is kate Stafford's work let's see here i don't think i listed the exact area where they deployed the hydrophone but they really weren't expecting to hear anything and they heard mating calls for very consistent and very clear for weeks at a time which is really fascinating that they just like unlocked this major secret but we do have different populations of bow heads up there right yes there's something I know we're not doing too hot yeah and the same thing with them the different populations of right whales they don't overlap habitats in the winter as far as we know I'm definitely not in Atlantic because they do document them pretty well off the coast of Florida they're seeing a lot this year yeah this year which is good I don't know they do a lot of aerial surveys for right well so they must migrate fairly close to shore last footage I saw was yeah I wanna say it was about just 10 miles offshore or something like that yeah I mean that's with a calf but even when they're traveling like humpback whales often or breeding often but not always breeding near shore but they could be hundreds of miles offshore while they're making the trek like I think about some of the North Atlantic humpbacks they could be couple hundred miles off shore but then maybe they're breeding you know close to the Dominican Republic or they're out at Silver Bank and the humpback whales from Alaska going down to why they're usually breeding near shore but they've crossed the entire open ocean from Alaska to Hawaii we're taking some kind of like zigzag route head inland and then head back out that is a interesting question that we got on the migratory patterns and the jury's still out on a lot of lot of animals yeah I don't know for a lot of them yeah we sort of yeah speculate they there's like another small upwelling zone off the coast of Costa Rica where there is enough food there for them to aggregate documentary it's on YouTube it's called the kingdom of the blue well yeah kingdom of the blue whales great it's actually it was on that geo show and it features John kalmyk ITA's from from Cascadia yeah and he literally follows the whales you know all the way down there to the dome yeah and that's where they think that the blue that they think the blue whales are giving birth down near the Costa Rican domes yeah and the one thing that they learn as Caitlin just said you know we always think of our humpbacks and blue whales you know feeding up here breathing down there but blues it turns out they're eating year-round well there's kind of like an upper limit of when you can be fasting for that many months and blue whales are beyond that they can't they're too big they can't fast for four months it's not possible because sighs yeah sperm whales are another one that the males migrate the females tend to stay towards the equatorial regions but the males will go all the way up towards like the polar latitudes like Alaska and and I don't know if they've been documented further north than that but they you know steal sablefish off their lines and there may be seasonal patterns that you may not necessarily call migration for like dolphins like you're more likely to encounter them in this area of their range during this time of year but I don't know if you could call that migration necessarily it's not really the breeding I've always wondered about that like for example we always get the question here in Monterey Bay you know winds killer whale season [Music] so rough I bet they blue bias and they're here but not yeah like one or two times a month and then October November you you you always tell me that maybe it's because the elephant seals are coming back to Mercury's they kind of come in near there which we didn't have this year and then April May the gray whales come up they want babies and the killer will like then one or two times a week then where it's more common yeah so I mean yeah it's particularly every month of the year you can see an orca here mm-hmm-hmm it's not really yeah migrant they just travel up and down the coast I mean it's the same thing with Rizzo's miles a day of moving around yeah you're more likely to see the Rizzo's when there's a lot of squid around and then if there's not a lot of squid like where do they go they just go further offshore really go somewhere else we don't really know I just wanna hang out with a birthday or any of them it was like a like while they're going somewheres I just want to see where they go yeah I probably figure it out I mean all the times there probably is going you know if you don't fifty miles down the coast like the humpbacks um you know when they leave but other ones like the Dolphins where are they going when they go straight off shore or like you know how many times you said you followed the killer whales into Carmel Canyon a car and then they go out shore and then they're gone and I've lost them there a couple times yeah yeah there we go this disappears like the ocean interesting like three-way Ridge down there and like if they're following the ridge first of all you have three options so now you're one boat you where to go and then if they're not following the ridge then you have no reference of where to even look for them yeah well you know what you guys what this was one hour five minutes Wow so I think we should probably end it here because people are gonna like give up halfway yeah alright let's call it yeah keep sending us questions though cuz that's some great stuff yeah guys you guys yeah great questions that I can see we couldn't really talk at length about some of them in a lot of these questions even if we don't know it's cool for us it gives us ideas what to look up and we gonna learn more too so I learned a lot from these podcast that's for sure so thank you so much for all those questions and comments and feedback make sure you guys are following us on Instagram and the well nerds and then we're trying to get our youtube set up so that they'll all be on there as well yes and yeah we'll try to add some of those resources that eric has onto the pot beam website and yeah thanks so much for listening thank you thanks a lot guys

hello everyone and welcome back to the welders podcasts this is episode 11 and I'm here with Eric and Caitlin hey everyone hello my name is Slater and were being well nerds we went and did a nerdy thing last week Eric nighted anything that we do we went to a talk by Rachel about fossils because apparently that's a thing now for oil nerds and rachel is actually an artist so he teamed up with a paleontologist from the Smithsonian and they did an adventure down the California coast well really the whole West Coast looking for fossils and and just writing about their whole adventure and then Rea Illustrated the whole thing so he had a really cool book and it was a friends of Hopkins event over at Hopkins marine station that night I don't know where were you we called you we told you about for the members oh yeah yeah but yeah pay money to be a friend of Hopkins I mean I'm friends of people that work at Hopkins in real life [Laughter] fake friends darn it so yeah so it was pretty fun raised a really cool dude he's like totally hippie and it's really fun to listen to him talk about there's two tours and his uh his drawings for the like Tree of Life are really neat I really liked all of those that he was talking about he has like actual trees and then the branches are related to how closely related each part of yeah it's really easy to understand the fact I thought of you Slater because you you were so fascinated with pakicetus and all that stuff so it's really visually did he paint pakicetus yeah he didn't yeah I got the book I'll show it to you later I just realized that I should show you but yeah he makes it really educational yet entertaining I mean it's it's pieces of art that you can have on your wall he had still learn a lot at the same time he's totally obsessed with desmos which are like these weird I don't even know how to describe it Eric I don't even they have what Jillian well let's just say well they're out here along California actually have a few pieces obtained on private property at my house but imagine a cross between I would say bear and sea lion probably yeah yes that's doing it yeah it's like a dinosaur that was like kind of between like the bear you have the sea lion in the water here's some of it yeah I got a few pieces out how do you know there were that teeth because it was really bizarre looking teeth though like they don't really look like anything else colors and I like little pillars a little hole in the middle and yeah they're over at shark-tooth Hill but this guy's book is a pretty cool talking about some of the animals that existed along the west coast the United States and those of you who are kind of a new paleo no we don't have many dinosaurs out here but a lot of marine mammal stuff out there and he talked about how partner Eddie talked about how his buddy was obsessed with walruses yes and how there were actually a few out here along the our Coast long time ago yeah so it's pretty fun pretty cool whenever we say like there used to be a long time ago it's like we lost a lot of things yeah that's true it's kind of sad I dream of seeing Steller's sea cow then the Cova see yeah there's well it's it's kind of interesting because like when you say a long time ago we really compressed millions of years when we say that like these whole ears of dinosaurs that were not meant to be and like we're never gonna exist at the same time as humans but then there are species that have gone extinct you know directly really like at the same time like that we'd probably kill them that but they just adopted it in a time that was more favorable to that type of animal and then by the time the environment had shifted again the Earth's atmosphere and the continents and everything and when humans finally came around it was like those type of animals were not going to survive on that type of in that current version of the planet yeah ready for Tesla no they were I heard a few talks and like viewpoints that people say like the downfall of like mammoths and sloths and stuff like that was because technology kind of caught up you know hunting tools yeah ten thousand years I was thinking the band ac/dc you were gone all Nikolai Tesla black yeah I did totally I went to another fun thing without you guys okay I sometimes how do our friends Art Show yeah sorry Sammy oh yeah oh you guys messed up there's snacks at that there was snacks and beer at that one mister but I was pretty cool actually I didn't realize like I don't know why I didn't realize cuz I read the thing but there was a panel and an art show happening so one of our our friends in co-worker Sammy had her art on display and it was a lot of marine artists and science communicators and so it was pretty fun to listen to the panel there was one guy who produced and directed and that it's on Netflix I think a documentary called the fork in the road I want to watch it it's about kind of like how awful the food industry is in the United States and and then there was a couple science illustrators Patrick Webster who's the social media guy for the Monterey Bay Aquarium Nerra Marion moderated the panel which is pretty cool I feel like he does a really good job curating the social media for them I saw some of Jamie's pictures on Instagram of her art display the yeah was she selling stuff there um she did have it available for sale I don't know if she made any sales there a lot of people I think were mostly just there to kind of but they were yeah yeah and they actually are gonna have an open house they solicited artists who put items up for donation which is a good opportunity for exposure because there's usually pretty good attendance at open house weekend so it was pretty awesome to listen to people talk about how the intersection of art and science is luckily in our area is really becoming a bigger and bigger thing science communications kind of like a hot buzzword right now and that just kind of reinforced you know my interest in continuing to to do the podcast and share all of information with people in this new way they actually did make a small shout out to podcasters they were like because someone asked a question like how do you how do you meet people where they're at you know and so someone was like well you need to be performing on platforms that people are using not necessarily something that you're versatile in but you need to go find where the people are and someone was like maybe that means podcasting that's something that scientists and science communicators are not really doing right now and I was like well let me tell you we have this cool podcast called the yeah so hopefully we pick up a few listeners from that but yeah I mean it just kind of reinforced my whole reasoning for for participating in this project has just been super fun and it was cool to hear that there's a lot of like-minded folks especially in our area I think we're pretty spoiled in that regard we have three really big marine research institutes and the aquarium and lots of ecotourism so we're definitely in a happening place that's awesome where was it where was that at at Moss Landing marine labs was there that's where that game Bari is right next door yeah well just a little bit before it yeah speaking of learning opportunities is it aren't they having their open house soon they are at the end of April it's I think the 26th and 27th yeah so for those you want to get out and just tour that facility young and all that if you're yeah they're having an open house it's a pretty neat environment over there you can check out the different labs walk in there and see all the different departments they have yeah they do some good science oh yeah start time all right you guys know it was in Wales Wales we're well nerd so I guess we probably should big dolphin biggest with us today the big dolphins that are in the news yeah so they spotted type D killer whales off of where New Zealand chilly chilly chilly chilly scientific team made the finding in January about 60 miles off the coast of Cape Horn Chile at the very tip of South America a regional the world's worst weather all right so they did find one in New Zealand 60 years ago yeah and it was not alive yeah so this is a story that came out in National Geographic today yeah published on March 7th yeah Wow so mysterious training of the elusive whale 60 years ago and now they got photograph of them today yeah so what happened was 60 years ago this what we as well nerds know as type D Orca a killer whale was found just the body and they finally publicly released that someone has actually seen them alive and swimming off of Chile and I think they actually took a biopsy on these and these type these are pretty amazing they have a really unique looking rostrum area head area kind of looks really bulbous to me and what they're really famous for is a very very very minut eyepatch it is a little tiny little white sliver the smallest iPad yeah the weirdest looking head yeah interests and for those of us who know yeah we look at the ecotypes they all look a little different and you know if they really want to get into it I mean again you probably have 9 10 different species if they really wanted to and you know have to be a you know scientist to see the differences I mean if you just look at these video videos and photos are going around you you know Facebook and everywhere right now on social media you could it doesn't take any one just to go these look there for it I mean even like the ones that we see here all the time residents transients you know we got open patch clothes you know clothes how the patch open saddle patch pointy ER dorsal fin rounded tip yeah so where do they feed on those guys I don't share with the biopsy if you don't meet you whales probably that big head you get ran whatever you want yeah it looks like they don't really have a good answer they just talked about the three other types type a Type B and type C that are in kind encountered in the southern ocean but yeah they don't say anything about what they think they feed on we actually got a question on Instagram yesterday and they said is there six ecotypes isn't there ten ecotypes it's pushing nine or ten yeah they might like split into dude yeah some people speculate there could be as many as 14 or 15 but I think that poster that eco Gorder Illustrated about five years ago shows I'm sure there's more than six oh yeah yeah so there's more than six but there could be more than ten even mm-hmm yeah yeah I mean time will tell the longer we studied these animals and we get opportunities to get biopsies that'll really be the interesting telling part because photo ID and observations is one thing but you know you look at for the first time in 60 years scientists have actually laid eyes on this type of animal there's been some anecdotal you know sightings and sometimes photos from people working out on the oh that little biopsy you'll be surprised that's gonna tell us a lot to do like you know I set up stuff they can they'll find out that diet that Slater was wondering about yeah and I feel like I say this all the time but it's still true like that's the coolest thing about like marine science like there's still so much room for discovery there's so much we still don't know yeah and we're the you know we're still gonna be uncovering all these interesting truths and mysteries like for a long time just because you're you're studying an animal that spends 75 to 95 percent of its life underwater you can't be underwater to follow them around and the oceans a big place and even from a ship that's really tall your visibility is not that great one two you're looking for animals more than two or three miles away from you so you know it's pretty easy to have a whale give you the slip and then what you lost like three weeks worth of searching for one whale you saw it for 30 seconds and yeah I'm staring at you cos poster right now and I'm looking at the beat whales you know it's like it's hard to believe yeah if all the science we have out there a lot of these animals are known just from a dead specimen oh yeah too many to count yeah it's amazing I think I've lost fin whales blue whales killer whales I think I've watched every type of whale probably every kind yeah pretty much every type of whale I've lost track of one gray whales can't give me this lid hey guys just wait another month in Monterey Bay and they'll give you the slip all the time whatever they can hold their breath all the way from here to santa cruz obviously the game would that be cool so looking at the poster some more happy news especially for buddies down down south they had those false killer whales show up at a new port yeah Oh talk about it we should wait oh okay we won't steal we won't talk about that yeah we also we also want to hear from one or two someones that we know that just caught back from a rad trip in Antarctica people are starting to come home and post photos on Facebook and I'm had being major FOMO yeah there's some amazing photos seen reaching killer whales penguins pooping it looks good can't wait friendly humpbacks yeah looked like a great trip and it sounds like the weather was pretty good the whole time - you look better than here lucky yeah I think they got to spend more time on the ocean with nicer sea conditions associated I saw some really crazy videos from an article the last couple weeks out really really they so the trip we're talking about our friends that went with the Cheeseman's they did not cross the drakes passage yeah and they were not sharing passage yeah they flew in from Yeshua so they didn't have to tolerate that gnarly crossing but some people did and I've seen some videos this season of it not being very nice they flew back maybe cuz they did you crossed once and that's when they say you can have a possibility to see blue whales and for someone I know did see blue was do you guys want to go we have we actually got a lot of responses on the questions on the Instagram story the other day okay yeah yeah so so jrc underscore productions asked have you guys ever seen white sharks talking whales are feeding on a carcass I've never seen them stalking anything I have per se but it wasn't a great white oh he's a shark and he said white sharks I saw I saw a mako with a flying fish he bit one fin off literally like three inches longer than the fish so he couldn't eat it and he didn't know what to do just like they were swimming in circles with each other for like a good like thirty five minutes we settled and we left them like they never could eat it it was really weird but yeah that's the only thing I've ever seen a shark like feeding on something they are attacking something alive okay sharks though eating whale carcass I've never seen that you haven't seen that only the only time I've seen a whale like I saw Wally dead on the ocean is the gray whale carcasses after the killer whales have fed on them otherwise I've just seen the dead whales on the beach and I've seen the shark bites but I've never actually seen them active like baby sharks I think I just saw shark bites on Wally and they dragged it back out again but yeah I don't know cuz I know a few people went over to PB when Wally was kind of floating out there for a while I mean I definitely want to see it and when there's dead things floating on the ocean always ask if we can go look at them because of depends on your captain I've been lucky I've actually seen yeah I've actually seen white shark eating a carcass between San Pedro and Catalina as a kid that was pretty cool to see whites and blues there I've seen I thought later when we saw that blue shark eating those very well intestines you remember that oh yeah saw that and on also Wow just like two or three months ago I got to see a white shark take out some type of pinniped just a tiny bit south of ano nuevo so yeah a few of us have been lucky enough to see predations out here or them going after dead stuff but yeah as Caitlyn said yeah she yeah we looked at that gray whale last year we saw a little tiny bites on the fluke somewhere blue somewhere white so yeah pretty much all the carcasses I've encountered humpbacks and gray whales on the beach have had some type of shark bite on them I actually went I rented a skiff from Capitola Wharf with Jody Frediani one of our dogs right yeah a couple years ago when the white shark I think it was like the second summer that the white shark said yeah and so we went and kind of tooled around just like in Idol basically with the sharks and that was kind of cool but for the most part they're just resting over there so it wasn't like they were like stalking any prey or anything but signs of white sharks yeah all the time in fact every morning I think all three of us leaving the trips scanning that wall out there but now yeah there's a lion there's a one I went out what to last week before last time I was out there was a sea lion with a pretty good-sized white shark bite yeah but for us here in Monterey we are in area known as the red triangle so a lot of white sharks here have you drew a line from Point Sur all the way up to bodega bay then out to the farallon's it creates a big red triangle and we are a hotspot for white sharks and I think it's because of our healthy population and rookeries here of pinnipeds so we got elephant seals sea lions harbor seal is a buffet in this area yes sir good question there I need more I'm reading through them a lot of them are asking about humpback songs and I feel like we've talked about that maybe one or two times episode 10 did we cover that pretty in-depth yeah I think we did we actually talked a little bit about the songs how they change and even the production I had a cool follow-up actually to episode 10 about migration routes I know we talked about like how do they learn them is it is it an eight or is it did their mom teach them and a cool paper came out from Oregon State University about blue whale migration and it does seem like it's more based on memory so there could be some teaching involved with that but also remembering where you found good food last time and then figuring out how to get back there so it's not necessarily something they're born with I think they got street signs under there can remember a certain like you know pinnacle or something down there I think they can like the killer whales or something but like some sort of marking they're like go left here and you're gonna hit Carmel you know yeah or go right it's like the turtles on Finding Nemo when they're in the the EAC and they know where to exit rip it roll it punch it so funny how you can use that movie for so many very some of them don't even say yeah so so we're chipping away at figuring out how how do whales know where to go when they migrate um blue whales are using a lot of memory tools we don't understand how that works yet but some of its just remembering where you found some good food last time I wasn't in Monterey whoa I mean yeah the human food situations [Laughter] right well I do have a question from someone actually it's from a lot of people so I'm not gonna name one name it's what are your guys's views on captive animals captive cetaceans specifically do you want to go first Caitlin you want me to go first anyone can go first I'll go okay my thought on the current situation is we know better so we should do better I personally don't believe that a lot of the that most of the animals that are currently in captivity are good candidates to be rehabilitated and tried to be put back out in the wild but I do think that we could make their life for however much longer it's gonna be in captivity a lot more comfortable and a lot more educational and a lot less performance some facilities are starting to shift that way but that's not necessarily true all around the world especially outside the United States and any animals that are gonna be brought in as future acquisitions should be animals that really couldn't be rehabilitated to the wild they're gonna be an ambassador individual for their species things like that we did learn a lot from the captive industry when we first started but I think we're kind of hitting the saturation point of what more we could learn I mean they've been in there for so many years I should have learned everything they can learn by yeah so you know I think it's mostly we need to really think about the welfare of the animals for the end of their days and and treat them with the utmost respect yeah I think I think we can all agree that we don't think they should continue being in there in the future we should stop producing these animals in captivity yeah and we have learned a lot from the being in captivity and then being in captivity has probably inspired a lot of us in the past before we even knew that it wasn't a good thing but yeah definitely I'm not standing for captivity but we've learned a lot and we should just slowly wean it as best as we can without you know hurting the animals that are still there now yeah I mean I have similar opinion of a lot of animals in captivity not just cetaceans yeah exactly yeah I think our opinions about the same in fact I love exactly how Katelyn started out we know better we should do better you know yeah it's 2019 all the years that we've been watching these animals you know we know what they need me coming from an aquarium background I'll tell you what yeah it it changed me for a bit if you have an animal there I honestly think these animals you know that are in there right now yeah we should give them the best life possible you know and if an animal is going to be taken into any facility I think it should strictly be a rescue situation you know for the animals own good but you know I do you think what what we have right now you know the stock that we have right now should be given a hundred and ten percent you know and we all know that looking at what happened at Keiko if we do try to you know put them back out there that's it's a it's a process that in fact I think we're probably still learning you know yeah millions were spent was Keiko you know in fact you know you go you gotta give free Willie props that really movie really opened people's eyes and mm-hmm you know what these animals need but you know there's pros and cons about it but yeah really opened people's eyes about about our large cetaceans well and it's it's interesting so a lot of people also like to use Springer as an example of an animal that was successfully rehabilitated yeah but she so she's a killer well um she's a resident type of fish eating time she was so young yeah yeah she's a 1l yes is she northern resident I think she's northern resident want to say yes because I feel like yes so she was like she was a really young whale that probably was still mostly nursing for Mom and was observed like away from the pod and so they did take her into captivity for a while but then we were able to successfully rehabilitate her back out into the wild she found was it her same family group or a family group and she has a calf so she she's a good Kees a good example of like there are certain situations where you could put an animal in captivity for a while make sure that their welfare their health is as good that they've learned all the skills they need to learn if they're young animal and then they can they can't go back out in the wild and be a sociable member of their pod like they do with sea lions seals elephant seals yeah you know they do that down south the Pacific Marine Mammal Center does it all the time yeah and I feel like bottlenose dolphin of that's been done successfully a few times in Florida as well but yeah I don't see the point in really promoting captive breeding anymore I think rehabilitating is you know not a bad thing but yeah captain keeping them captive is a whole different story yeah so maybe I would advocate for those type of facilities to shift their primary focus to rehabilitation and not necessarily entertainment yeah exactly and you know they're the people's opinions are so strong on this but I think we should all think instead of thinking you know about the hate situation there should be more let's think about the animals we all have a general entry of here it's the animals that were concerned about and you know I don't think anyone at these marine parks are sitting there going man I hate Orca you know yeah but you know what stock is still out there and all these parks that should be given 110% and you know as he said yeah we know better so let's do better nowadays yeah yeah and I personally would never you know visit a marine mammal park yeah I don't think I would anymore either I'm definitely not gonna support any of them remail parks anymore but I do think there's some good that has come out of them so I'm not gonna completely exactly yeah me you know I think maybe all three of us as a kid yeah yeah we went to see a world we probably went to Marineland I never went but I didn't grow up in California either so I mean if I had grown up in the area where it was drivable yeah I bet I would have gone and that's the stuff that is literally just some young kids that's gonna spark their interest in their own opinions you know yeah I mean I did see Keiko when I was a kid he was at the Oregon Coast Aquarium so there's that yeah I still remember every yeah every like every moment spent that marine land and I still remember that and that's the stuff that really made me go oh man you know I want to do that I wanna do that for me personally people always ask me can you please you know let everybody know that SeaWorld sucks or like this sucks but for me I'd rather not even give them the time and then just say go whale watching like if you want to get inspired and it's really inspired and see these animals in the wild go whale watching yeah there's seriously nothing better than that especially if you're already in the vicinity of like SeaWorld in San Diego get on a whale watch boat instead exactly that's that's my two cents is like if you can see them in the wild for the same price or maybe even less money go see him in the wild yeah you buy one soda at SeaWorld it cost so much your old ticket so I currently now I currently will try to avoid the places with was to take with you know cetaceans rumery mammals but the people who do end up there hopefully it does you know at least make them care for the animals and let them develop their own you know opinions about what should be done so yeah it's just a thing but it's definitely I just want the best for the animals let's just say that a touchy subject subject so let's move on yeah I mean you don't have to agree with us either that's just you know you solicited our opinion then there you have it we all love the animals like I said there is I don't think there's anyone you know at any Marine Park one man I hate seals and sea lions I hate Orca we all love them so let's try you know find some altogether find some common ground yeah what else we got question what are some ways that you can support research and conservation especially living far from the ocean oh yeah that's a good one good one who wants to go donate money to say anymore no no I'm just we don't have active situation research going on right now well I think doing your part to raise awareness about how human beings impact ocean no matter where they where they are is important so if that means participating of cleanup of your local waterways or Park or you know working even in like a recycling program in your local community or making small daily choices every day to reduce your impact on the planet in general it's a good way to kind of just start you know living conservation daily but there's also organizations that if you feel like they're doing good work you can donate to them try your best to not use plastic as much as you can I mean it's so hard because I need a bag of chips and then there's plastic so I mean I've I try my hardest to not do it but I mean we all do it some way or another mm-hmm I'm the worst I've you know accidentally bought like like I love soda water and sometimes it doesn't come in like like it's weird Pellegrino you know look I have a glass one here is any only carry plastic ones that's like you know and obviously I can choose not to buy it but I'm guilty I bought and so mm-hmm so I think trying to cut out single-use plastic as much as you can it's definitely a big way to help the marine environment you know and just the environment and all you know the doctor Noren who spoke about the walruses at ACS um last week she actually had a donation form in the back of the room to directly support her research so if you like get hooked on like beluga whales and you find this lab that studying beluga whales and you have some money that you would like to donate just talk to the researcher and be like hey how can I support your your work and sometimes in-kind donations are even better than money because if you have a piece of equipment that they need or you can facilitate getting that for them and give it to them that way then the Foundation's often that facilitate the money donations don't get a cut of it so like say you want to donate to dr. Nora $1,000 she only gets 500 of it because the foundation of her University takes half the money yeah there's a few other ways that I I think would work too for people who don't live by the ocean even if you live by a local River and stuff like that if you understand the process with watersheds you know anything literally any body of water flowing water stuff that goes in that's gonna end up in the ocean you know so protecting your local rivers and waterways helps out another thing that I actually helped participate in a while ago is kind of like volunteer vacation programs you know there's a number of programs out there I think Earth watch is one of the major ones where you can pretty much go like on a like a working vacation help out a researcher or scientist and you know at a location that's obviously away from home so you kind of get a little bit of a vacation and you're also helping out this Reacher researcher or scientists protect these animals or work on these animals that they're concerned with also I know there's a few know down in Mexico there was a few programs where you can actually help out a sea turtle farm you know release eggs and take care of the eggs and stuff like that so there's numerous programs out there that would be willing to you know have you help out and you'll kind of get a little mini vacation out there so yeah there's a lot of ways you can help out even though if you're not directly living by the sea like us yeah there's also the wheels of Carrera research group they do like one-week vacation similar to a lot of the sea turtle programs so you pay to go down there and you do whale research with the local community and scientists which is pretty cool yes that is very cool so get creative and and I think there's lots of choices we can make every day with our behavior to reduce our impact on the planet whether that's not eating as much red meat or choosing less plastic or anything they're all staring at me what you still next question just think about just think about how you interact with your environment every day and maybe choose how to do that more sustainably I agree you know one thing I realized is also if you got the time sometimes even helping out like today obviously most of our listeners are wildlife lovers you know sometimes helping out at a zoo or any facility if you feel yeah wildlife rescues you know you'll be helping out animals and that probably even helped educate people so you know find a facility that you agree with their viewpoints and stuff like that and that be also something that would be beneficial for you and you'll be helping out educate these folks out there how about the CA fifty ones what about them any questions I think they just said the same bling man tell them they don't even come to Monterey and I don't want to be their friend yeah I've seen like one time here since I moved here and now they just oh I mean they're known as like it's my computer's up so let me thank you let me pull up the log right here and I think I'm gonna have to go back to 2018 unfortunately yeah yeah I don't know if I hit 2018 it's only three months into 2019 settle down I'm sure I heard a rumor for the busy they're watching other LA Academy but there were killer wells in Carmel Bay today what do you mean nobody saw them they're on Bob I'm now officially a team Emma in West pod oh yeah you know I'm all about the MS pod now they show better it's pretty cool there's great whale assassins dude yeah they kill things which is awesome are you active and they show more than the Capt ones even though when you do see the fifty ones they're pretty friendly okay I've had some pretty not friendly encounters jinks I'm looking at my log here I want to say here in Monterrey for me personally I want to say it's it was April actually no you guys come up here and use this for our gray whales actually sat here might have been May May 6 but yeah fifty ones tonight I wonder if I was here that day yeah they're in the area were they fighting with a battle yeah so yeah the question was just what about those fifty ones but I think you know the other fifty ones it's it's for for individuals that have been known to be pretty pretty uh active at times even known to be boat friendly one of the younger males in there is named bumper and if you know but burries man he's getting big he's router now he's proud of that dude he's like four he spends almost yes eyes now but he's been known to as his name says he's he has touched boats I personally got that witness him actually bow ride yeah I think it was a triumph of a few years back and then before eight seconds comment ah Ryan instance star stars the mom the two boys Orion and bumper will hang out with her for the rest of her days or their days and comet is the little youngest girl they do have an older sister who has a couple kids of her own to and she split off yeah and she made her own pod when she hides her own yes they're cool it's like three females in that pod there might be yeah so it's her and her two babies and then there's one whale that we speculate is a female but some people everyone smile we got a sprouting mail the new one is the ones that were wack in the burger you wanted that's 49 see that hangs out with her there 51 days don't know much about the 51 days because I think this was my first year last year was my first year seeing them 50b was hanging out with them a lot this year too that male here and they were here to stay yeah after his mom died he started hanging out with them and they speculated that maybe maybe they're related awesome they can be pretty cool they can also be you know wait for April I hope they come early and stay long because er you can stay as long as you want there's a whole wall of sea lions you guys have no offense you guys are cute and cuddly but good killer will be so yeah see a fifty ones for us California whale watchers yeah I've seen them what schools yeah I saw em off of Santa Cruz like my first time seeing a lot of Santa Cruz Island and 2011 or 12 and comment what still it's your first time yeah comment was still yellow so for those of you that maybe don't know what that means when they're still yellow so when killer whales are born they don't have a very thick fat layer so their blood vessels are up at the surface of their skin and there's not really a whole lot of insulation there so you're actually seeing kind of through the eye patch which is white kind of like their blood vessels yeah they're straight out they're straight out talk that it is like straight up jaundice too you know a lot of people they don't get it so yeah yeah that's Kerri I'm curious about they're saying it's not from this they don't know it could be joking - but I told people though the fact you guys I mean as far as we know still science you have to put that caveat on a lot of things about that it's my little yeah yeah and as they as they grow and as they gain weight they seem to become yeah more white but in fact that we do not know it's the fact we don't know exactly why yeah it's that blood issue that Caitlyn same or you know some people are straight out saying oh no it's gone - yeah but you can't be jaundiced for like three years I'm still yellow oh wait whoa four dozen oh no me that was funny how much do we actually know about well reproduction and birthing nothing not a lot well anyone know I I mean they just said whales we know some about dolphins yeah we've seen dolphins give birth there's videos of it there's just absolutely no videos of baleen whales giving birth yeah that Maui video is like the closest thing and that was this year yeah you know we talked about that on yeah we're start kind of they've kind of figured out just stationed sexual maturity and stuff like that but yeah love it's a mystery I never thought about that it's like how do we exert how do we know it's 13 months but we know when they come back to the lagoon yeah I mean for for animals that migrate you know you give it a range of 11 to 13 months are they get getting pregnant on the southbound journey are they actually getting pregnant in the breeding grounds are they getting pregnant on the northbound journey we see mating in all three places and we see especially gray whales we see moms giving birth anytime from like south of San Francisco down to Mexico so is it 12 months 11 months I hope so I hope I get it yeah it's bound to happen I hope anyone marine mammals whales in particular and finds our seas of birth like him yep do you know be a friend and then um there's been some speculation actually about um like some midwifing with killer whales um the residents the last two births there's been rake marks on the calf like almost like another whale had helped pull the calf out we don't really understand what's going on that but a newborn calf with rake marks on its back like in an area that makes sense for it to be helped getting pulled out of that right now yeah if it's in a pod I bet someone would I mean if killer whales have enough finesse with their teeth to skin a salmon or skin a sea lion or like pull the spine out of something of course they can just get a cow meat off a tiny little hairy yeah yeah of course they have the finesse also help okay speaking about the rig marks I posted an old video of killer whales spinning a strand and spinning us or going great okay if you guys go to 27 - no no look at these rake marks you can see it on the side yeah do you think that because that could even be from a sea lion he's not a big mark that might not even be from another whale could be from something they were eating interesting yeah yeah anyways that's crazy on the side like that big one yeah I mean I'm used to seeing rake marks - either like on the tail or on the near the dorsal fin you know in the saddle patch a lot going back to the CI 51 um one time not long after they had been sighted in British Columbia trying to think I think it was bumper had four big rake marks through his left eye patch and then like several months later when we sighted him it actually had healed up and it was white again but he had these black rake marks through his eye patch I was like man he's looking so gnarly these days he's got a ripped fin it's bent he's got rake marks on his eyepatch but then he healed up an e/m he looked okay after that you know that this photo right here oh yeah there's Rick Marty down they Wow both sides of the door walking I walked away up and pointed at my my picture is hanging on the wall but yeah I mean lonesome George has huge rake marks in this saddle patch next time you see him or if you go through photos of him look at his saddle I think George is a badass especially with that PEC fin I think he he bro you know he's gonna chop anything out of it so I have there's a photo that went a little crazy on Instagram like just go I brought it back I brought this photo back up and lonesome George is a orphaned male kill a transient killer whale and he has this huge chunk out of his left pectoral fin we don't know what it's from I mean I've heard sea lions I've heard it was I don't know was it wasn't always there right because they probably seen him breech before I've seen him breech before and he's not had the chunk and that's been within the last I would say within the last two years he's probably had that yeah seems like his last two years yes so we don't know what it's from right I mean some people say maybe like an elephant seal bit him on his it seems almost too perfect it's like you yeah really Pressey shaped and very clean like dude shark bite him I don't know might never yeah I think maybe shark just come up in mystery why would a shark a killer robot do you don't hurt them I don't know he thinks that big sir a lot by himself maybe he got into some weird stuff we got a white shark gang he doesn't hang out with any crowd the points are white shark games you know so cool is like like we saw that see a 199 you know Eric down the coast oh yeah I did that we need yours yeah that big wavy dorsal fin read about know you called me I was like with the drone and what to call it I was like wait a second his PEC fin is Norfolk yeah we knew it was it George I was like look back and you like yeah he was almost as big as here as George so that's really impressive that's I think well isn't it well it was like it's so funny because when I took that photo we were just like five-point peanuts kind of out of I get three or four my for about four miles out probably and we had lunch feeding humpbacks in Clearwater and this humpback at a mouthful and I was like dancing under the water like spinning over I don't dream and we're there one it's kind of out of the frame but I was like stoked on the day like let's go and like JJ's like I see a killer whale and I was like okay like don't lie to me didn't he like this starts going towards it I was like and then I found it again maybe lost it oh my gosh I was freaking out like super crazy lunch meeting Clearwater happiness and then even better and then even you called me you were cray cray yeah you were stoked on every tune he was huge big Oh Ellen that's the one that's chopped it's not bubble so so kind of tie this back to our original question about reproduction here's something we don't really know especially about transient killer whales who are the dads of all these calves a very matrilineal structure everything centered around mom but like are they inbreeding we kind of think they don't but like the residents don't they kind of injury didn't they do genetics on them and like they're a little bit but they're I don't know but by genetics but don't you think that maybe like Kay came over to Jay and because like they know that L they found out Jay Jay Jay was technically L well yeah there's a lot of funny stuff about what's going on yeah it's so late that's that that's a whole another level of mystery of things we don't know we pretty much all the time we don't know who the dad is there's no paternal care in any these whales Inamori show you are not the father yeah so just adding that level of complication mysticetes for sure are very promiscuous there try a lean whales are trying to mate with as many partners as they can during migration is that true of other well I mean I say common dolphins are pretty primitive oh yes dolphins are gnarlie so while I was up there with the rest of the resident there's a male killer well named onyx which is l87 and he always hangs out with j-pod so they said something about him having like a crush I don't want it yeah so to add more mystery to the whole question about reproduction and birthing and all that I mean we have some species worked out just station period we've seen him give some species give birth in the wild or in captivity but a lot of it yeah a lot of it's a mystery no yes later said no large well you know we've seen give birth I think well get close especially with all the technology I think it'll happen soon and I another thing that I think may happen sometime soon is more evidence and recordings from drones of like heat runs and fin whales and blue whales we don't really see them mating a whole lot I think actually some of the best footage probably comes out of that Sri Lankan blue whale proposed yeah but like yeah I mean we've only heard of heat runs a handful of times off the California coast for blue whales I don't think it's ever really been well-documented for fin whales so yeah I mean I think even those type of things are probably gonna be recorded and be breaking news soon yeah so yeah so basically we don't know a lot yeah that's alright we're learning we're always learning all right you guys well sure there's a few more topics but I'd like to save them for another episode okay just because if okay guys we need to tell you something we're probably gonna bring it back down actually I think we're gonna bring it back down to one a week and it's just because we don't want to go through every single topic at once you know and once we start getting back into the spring and summer season we're gonna have whales to look at yeah we're gonna whale to look at and sightings to talk about and encounters and all sorts of cool stuff so we'll save topics for you know new things that we see mm-hmm and yeah so we're probably gonna just put one out every Monday yeah yeah we can definitely as you can see here cover you know as many topics as we can just in one one recording so yes please keep the questions coming and we've been getting some pretty good wasn't as you can see yeah yes it's been finally answering your questions and like they said there's it's been some really really good ones lately so keep sending them our way and you'll get your well fixed to start the week every Monday yep and if you guys aren't following us on Instagram for some reason it's well nerds follow us there send us comments and dm's about topics and hopefully we'll get to those and i hope you guys all have a fantastic week yes thanks for listening thank you thanks everyone goodbye

hello everyone and welcome back to the well Nerds podcasts this is episode 12 and I'm here with Eric and Katelyn hello hello everyone and I feel like we haven't podcasted in forever we missed you all your because yeah someone was out petting whales and swimming with whale sharks well it wasn't just that we also went down to one day a week so yeah it's true because you guys don't want to give us topics no cuz we're all about to be vacationing a whole bunch and getting back to work no vacations we have day job occasion when you're watching whales what canada√≠s it's always a vacation when you're watching with yeah exactly lucky people so did I miss anything while I was gone yeah kind of yeah but we want to hear about your trip first cuz we're chomping at the bit there's too much to tell you guys you know it freaking let it rip what do you want to hear about first how'd you get there yeah plane I flew in to Cabo yeah on a normal plane and then we took like a small charter plane two planes changing automobiles I take a charter plane from Cabo to La Paz and then in La Paz we stayed at a hotel there and then the first day we did or they say it was the second day actually we went in swim with whale sharks which was absolutely mind-blowing have you there be smooth well sharks have you seen well sharks they haven't been in the water with them see them at the water during the El Nino we actually had them up before yeah this seems like oh yeah that's awesome well yeah so we swam with the whale sharks we had epic conditions the ocean was just flat other weather there's no wind is flat calm on the water and the clarity the water visibility was probably like 10 or 15 feet which was really nice and then what had and I and I to lunch in this secluded little remote beach off of one of the islands in front of the pause and then we went to mercy lions whichever would see lies before but it wasn't in the was there's nothing but sea lines any fur seals around everything no it's just all sea lions and uh there was a triggerfish there was parrotfish nice what was that fishy sauce I think you looking at your pictures I think there's a sergeant major yeah a military fish yeah there was some cool fish the sea lions at first there wasn't really any in the water there was two males actually really cool they one was just biting another one on the butt they were doing that circle yeah chasing each other underwater that was cool and then we went through this like long archway to the other side of this it's basically like a huge rock and then we went through the archway and man the lighting was so cool coming to backlighting through these fish in the tunnel orgeous was I was like stuck in the tunnel for a little bit they're like are you gonna continue on we got sea lions on the other side and I like taking pictures of fish so that was cool then we swam with sea lions at the end we had like three or four of them cruisin around chasing each other I just love how they blow the bubbles and yeah like in-your-face kind of they're so like it's like scary how agile they are underwater you watch them and it's funny cuz weed so we were split up into two groups so we had the whale sharks in the morning and then we all meet for lunch and then they go to the well sharks he hit the sea lions up mhm well the people that were on the first group with the sea lions they were like it's funny it seems like they always keep you in their peripherals well when we when we were swim with sea lions they were always like out in front of you and they had their head just slightly turned and you could see their eye looking looking at you yeah like they were always like they always knew where you were and they had a little angle and they were for sure checking us out and then the other you know another seal on would come up and then they would like chase each other and yeah and they leave like that bass and then they were back that fast it's just it's pretty crazy so questions you said the first day was well short day yeah well the first day was kind of traveling they knocked around the city which was really cool the positive cool architecture there I guess it was very like French in Spanish a lot of people came there yeah I think it was for a lot of it was for oysters or yeah like pearls and stuff uh-huh so there was a lot of different architecture which was really cool so then technically yeah the second day was the full day in the water how did like when you guys went to the whale sharks like how did they look for me just basically look for a big fin just pop out of the water oh yeah we pretty much left the harbor you know we went past it like rock wall and I made a left and there's like a long stretch of sand and like kind of like a little peninsula that comes out uh-huh within the peninsula okay whoa Inception yeah I'm serious and then so we're like you know all chatting they're giving us the rundown about lifejackets not to dive underneath them and how to be respectful and stuff and next thing you know the captain is like right there and it's funny as soon as I looked up I wasn't looking you could start seeing him everywhere oh cool you do see the dorsal and then you can sometimes see the tail Hoshi that's mainly there kind of like a tangle so I think a lot of times you're really just seeing the dorsal mm-hmm and we're seeing their head you can see them they're doing that vertical feeding yeah yeah so you see these little funnels of water like getting sucked into the ocean oh no way it's a yes he's a little likes kind of like slick spotty funnel how big is the biggest one you think you saw man there was one that was like really big and she was like you know this is probably not a juvenile so that what they're saying is where we were watching them is they were pretty much they're all juveniles they feed inside up and they come up in there yeah and then they go out to the Pacific okay so the big ones will go out to the Pacific and then these ones will actually also go out to the Pacific right like towards the end of the season I think it's within the next couple of months oh cool that's when easily people are seeing them out you know towards like okay yeah that's way up there what's so what's the season like if someone goes later I want to do what you did wouldn't should they be there so I think it's October to like May it's a really war they said I'll over November's like it's hard to get people on the water because it's bath water okay like crazy warm and so yeah back to the biggest one I think I would say is like 13 no like 12 meters wow that's no that's like 40 feet uh-huh yeah so no less than that I would say it was probably like like 28 feet so pretty impressed really big yeah I closer and the pattern on these whale sharks is just so many dots on the thing a board shorts they have sneakers I saw going around the internet though yeah you see like fish patterns and stuff like that like you know like Dorado patterns but I would love to have like a whale shark pattern shirt or set up board shorts nothing made like that yeah I'm sure they make them now guys might really get something on my body I wish that'd be cool you know a new species that I haven't seen before and all those dots and lines there supposedly like a did he talk about like how they can I talk about yeah they did talk about identification and I think it's a man I forget it was how to do something towards the back like they can use that dorsal fin in the tail because a lot actually a lot of time to get hit by boats because they're you know they're always at the surf yeah yeah and not always but they're for the most part they're at the surface so they actually most of the ones we saw had some sort of like nick out of their tail or dorsal fin mm-hmm so they use that just like they would you know killer whales or dolphins yeah and then also the modeling or the the design that they have on him the pattern that's so cool yeah I was you don't realize how wide there that the first initial look we had at them they were like alright here's one right here you know and you peek over the side and you're like whoa this thing is huge and because we had permits to fly the drone and we like to film in the water so it was like this we're like what do we do like should we fly and we were both because there's another pilot that's doing working on a little film with them telling a story about some turtle stuff I'll talk about later well I was like we just looked at each other like to be fire okay you get a couple of minutes I'll get a couple minutes and then like because we had people that wanted to get in the water so we kind of he did it like a couple initial clips and then I did some photos and then we hopped in the water and then just went from there and we said we did like and we first got there they were really just circling around in one area and like and they just turn right at you you're like thinking you're like falling it you know off - it's like left or right side behind it and the next thing you know it's like you're looking changing your camera settings and things in your face you can't you can't swim and reverse it trying to not move and like slowly sink backwards away from them that's so cool yeah it wasn't it was incredible so and then I think once more boat started showing up because there's obviously other tours mm-hmm that are in the area the whales started to do more of like a straighter swim back then like circling but what's really cool is how regulated it is there they actually have to call in to like their government or whoever the harbor master is kind of thing and they have to get a permit every day and you do not get one so you can you know book a tour and then they'll say sorry you know we didn't get one today Wow we got really lucky they had been calling in like all week long making sure that we get a permit that to be able to just go see them in the first place that was beyond like the photography stuff uh-huh but we ended up getting permits for everything which was just awesome and then yeah we went from there had the lunch and I went swimming with the sea lions that's so cool and then we had a great dinner and the next morning we woke up at like 7:00 had breakfast got in the van and then we did in a three-hour drive to Magdalena Bay mm-hmm and we had lunch right when we got there we broke it up we had like a bathroom break on the way there halfway through half way to Magdalena Bay yeah we got right on the boat they carried our lug they took another boat I think with our lottery know how our luggage got to the island we left our luggage in the van brought everything we no camera equipment wise I love the bow everything we needed to go whale watching and then we went out there and just saw those great whales oh so nice and it was horrible worse well watch it looked like you had the worst time now our time I was telling them how I feel about gray wolves being somewhat boring yeah you so obviously here mama got all the time on the boat more scared and they have a lot of things to worry about here in Monterey so I told them and then you know we get out there and within like probably 20 minutes the other boat had you know we had two boats out there with it was another boat with us we were split up into groups of five and six and the other boat had a gray whale right on their bow and at this point we're taking pictures at their boat and then we're all kind of like getting kind of antsy and sour I want I want to watch it happen to us and then we noticed that they were we were all talking on our boat so no one was doing the little splashing wouldn't ya a little handle thing and so they were and we told our guide were like hey why are we not splashing so then we're all like splashing and then next you know his cruises right over to our boat that's cool and then came over to the boat we all you know we all got really close looks at it mm-hmm then just like lifted his head up up against our boat and then we were able to reach out and and kind of give it a little pet cool you know I only did it two times I've barely very lightly touched it uh-huh and then the rest of the time I was just you know filming so yeah I was just I had so much going on I don't know you didn't know I wasn't doing anything I was just blocked out yeah I was just like so I don't one side of the boat to the other I remember my first few experiences almost forgetting that whales had blow holes did you did you get yelled no I felt like I was really looking at was I was like because it would come up and I'm like is he gonna exhale back up and then you know he really like didn't give you the clue of when he was gonna actually blow yeah when she was gonna do it actually one of them flipped over we were able to tell that I was a girl oh cool do you guys want to explain real quick how you can tell the slits yeah yeah so is it I always tell people it's like a division two females are like a little a-line with two dots yeah it's a good man yeah the males are kind of like an exclamation point yeah yeah all right well anyways that single well we had ended up leaving us after it went on its own and then we kind of both split up and our one boat just took off you know down the beach there was well spyhopping breaching you know rolling over you can see the PEC fins all all up and down the beaches they were just everywhere and so we started to follow our other boat because they were leaving too and then Chris crowd goes hey why aren't we just looking at the swells right next to us and we turn in and so in Spanish you guys I turn around just look at this one she told her captain well we stopped and we're just waiting for them to come up next thing you know I'm looking over side trader your trader you're the two whales right into the boat both lift their heads up at the same time just like you can't even the mouth is like an upside down smile and you can see it from one side of the boat all the way to the other and I'm on the head yeah just the mouth like just a rostrum and we're all like where's the ayat' like it's just so far back you know cuz the eyes like select like what right underneath the mouth on the back edge of the jaw mhm and man I'm laying on the bow looking on both sides of the front of the boat and they just took turns you know both lifting their head up and I never I didn't touch the two second whales and what they think what was going on was they for sure knew one was a female and they think maybe the other one was a male and they were using us as the third party yeah they were doing a lot of rolling around now I wasn't weird so that's what they mean that's just what they assumed was going on we don't know for sure but yeah and there was a lot of mom and babies in the lagoon oh and cool III don't feel like I could have had a better first experience we got you know we got the really close encounters we saw this by hopping anywhere the mom and babies were you know the mother the baby was rolling on top of the mom none of the baby went to the other boat we didn't have the baby come to ours so we never got their mom and baby next to our boat uh-huh that's the only thing we didn't have but I mean I had more than enough I was even I couldn't even deal with what we had yeah yeah so that was cool we went back to the camp and so when we got back to the camp we had like we had a margarita we also celebrated our first experience with the gray whale and then we actually went with them too so this camp also does a turtle I don't even know what would you call it like not a research in concert yeah it's like research and conservation so basically what they used to be fishing this used to be a full fishing town and they used to catch these Turtles as bycatch and these nets and so they stopped fishing in like 1996 or 99 and these people had heard what was going on with the Turtles and know they were being killed yeah you know and and all the things that are going on there with plastic and all the other things and so one of the old fisherman like heard people talking in his dive shop and he was like wow like I didn't even know this was going on he's always hunted them and so you know he decided to stop hunting them and they asked him to come and work in this this research with of the Turtles and so what they did was they used the same nets they opened him up wider they took the weights off the bottom because what was happening as the turtles were drowning yeah it's on the bottom of the net and so if they got caught in the middle of it they couldn't you know get to the surface so they're using these same nets and you know it seems kind of weird at first that they're still catching them but what they're doing is they're they're they're allowing them to still breathe so they just catch them they bring them on the boat they're checking these nets every two hours and they only do it once every month so it's a 24 hour period once a month every two hours they pull these Turtles onto the boat and they measure them a billion different ways it seems to like you know with high like all you know across the show both ways yeah from the top of the shell to the they have like a two little points at the end of their shell yeah and so from the longest point to the top of the shell and then they weigh it and then they tag it and they send it on its way and basically they're just gathering data to see what the population is doing and it was mainly greens you saw yeah was all green sea turtles and I think from what I sounded like I heard they do get occasional like maybe a hawk or something yeah but mainly it's just just green sea turtles and yeah it's pretty cool I think the one weighed like about 60 pounds but before we got there one of them weighed over a hundred pounds uh-huh there's a big old turtle that's bad yeah so it was really cool to get to see the turtles up close and push them like do the measurements and all that on them it's funny because I'm not used to hearing centimeters and I asked the measurements and I like what's the sediment and then on top of that it's in Spanish so it's like a really big number that I don't know so that what that was cool it was really cool that they do this all through the night and so they were willing to take us out every two hours if we wanted to do it through the night most of us were so tired so we did I think one group did at 9:00 p.m. and then after that the crew actually just sleeps on the ponga and they wake up every two hours check the net because and then to measure them if there's any and they and then throughout the whole night they only got one more in the very morning and they brought they they actually match they bring it to land they measure it there because easier on the boat yeah and then they let him go and then the next morning we woke up went on the laguna that went out in the lagoons again saw some great whales we didn't have any friendly encounters and then we went and looked at some more frigates Oh totally skip that yeah I know any bird pictures for me yeah yeah we saw there was a huge rock wall that they put a it's kind of a long story they said they used to farm oysters for pearls and this guy created like a big rock wall so the tide would go in on one side so the the oysters could get the oxygen or the you know the new water yeah and then it would go back out they eventually stopped that it was that it was a governor at one point that was doing it and anyways it's done now but this huge rock wall is now filled with frigate oh cool it was cool because some of them still had like the breeding like they had a big little red pouch yeah but one of them had it blown out pretty cool was a big bubble cool he's blown a bubble you know so yeah they were saying that there though they have the biggest wingspan to body ratio of any bird really yes okay so wingspan to body not the biggest wingspan yeah let's panda by size yeah and then two to three weeks they can fly one time really two three weeks and okay same thing as dolphins they'll shut down half their brain mm-hmm and they're actually taking like micro naps like very a couple seconds and they're pretty crazy yeah so they can't touch the water because they don't have the oils like a pelican or a goal would have the water would just soak into them underneath their feathers so the only way they'd be able to get out as if they could get to land and like crawl out and then they'll dry off yeah so they can't two to three weeks out there I mean we've seen frigates here in Monterey and if they're nesting down in Mexico that's a fly-in yeah but in there for once and you know there's white here and all over but at least they can take a rest yeah at least they can sit on the water yeah that's gnarly Steve Hal told me that one time he's a he's bird guy from California and that just like blew my mind I was on the boat and he was like oh yeah frigate bird it's gonna be like in the air like flying around two or three weeks I was like excuse me yeah and yeah I totally believe it the way they were talking about they were ethnic really like yes two to three weeks yeah he's the one that also told me the fact about like albatross we'll forage in California while on nest in Hawaii so they have to be able to fly like one way two to three days I don't know how far is it 5,000 miles to Hawaii no not that far I think oh yeah all right airplane ticket or will it actually tell you we uh yep so then frigate and I feel like there are some other birds any boobies probably oh yeah there was movies there sometimes yeah we get him there and then there was a lot of great blue herons nesting 2471 miles from like this still 3,000 miles it's pretty fun yeah yeah that's pretty cool plus they're not just going straight they're going all wrong yeah they probably do about seven drops are actually out at Midway so that's even further yeah so yeah it was incredible and I highly highly recommend you going down to Baja and see these whales there's four major lagoons there San Ignacio Magdalena Bay career Negro and what sort of scam ins Lagoon and definitely I want to highly I want to recommend that you look for a company that has good reviews and that you can tell would be respectful because I did see some stuff in the lagoons that I thought was not like yeah best practices it wasn't from our boat was from another boat and it looked like they had been in depth talk to you by the authorities so just look for a boat that looks like they'd be respectful they are it is very regulated and I know it's even more regulated in San Ignacio mm-hmm so it would probably be hard to find a bad boat yeah but just just keep your eye out make sure you're not going with someone that's gonna harass the whales just so you can get a good look and let's tell people the the time did you go there if they want to do a yeah February is like when they're just starting to get there so I definitely want to go at the end of March I think that's when all the males have left and then it's really just mom and babies and I think that they're usually the most friendly so you have what end of March well the whales still be there when I get there I don't know yeah I think it's gonna be more friendly when you get there yeah we have to look up and see if I can see some whale sharks too because people would went to week before I got there and they said it was alright like they were super friendly they said I think it's gonna get even better yeah and it was better when I got there so I bet it's gonna be me oh my I get there aha Lagoon trips have been the end of march into like the first few days of April and they've been spectacular so yeah you guys are right April they're probably gone huh oh yeah so yeah it has to be end of March I would say but I mean if you getting consumed if you can get there anytime in March you know it's still probably a good time to go but the later than March the better good luck Caitlin Caitlin leaves a few days for ya yeah I'm excited to hear about her experience down there and I hope you try to see that well sharks at least on your way back if they're still there I think they will be look it up and see if we can go we have one day in La Paz but you're gonna try to go there to fly well she flies into the past you might as well if she gets the nope ah kaitlin can I have some time off next week what nothing you want to go down there well sharks yeah I've been been in the water with the Welsh is there no what we could go in August that'd be bad ballet for August right yeah yeah we can go I mean you could meet me there is that what but he means does that mean BAE BAE yes II speaking the Spanish okay maybe they're on the 28th of March Eric can have the day off so I gotta ask my boss yeah actually you're working for your other boss that day so yeah you can have the day okay did I feel like I did I leave out anything about my trip um it was with the oceanic Society oh yeah yeah me some cool people are some people I didn't leave that out I just didn't get to that they were awesome people yeah we did have one of the Kratt brothers on the boat we had a lot of great people on the boat but I don't know if you guys have heard of what is it I don't know and it's basically like there's two brothers that do like wildlife stuff and they have a lot of awesome shows they have I think there's some animated ones down and they do a lot of live stuff so that's pretty cool it was one of my James when I was a kid yeah yeah I don't remember a lot but now I've seen it but the oceanic society not only does a lot of cool ocean conservation especially with Turtles they also do a lot of trips they do stuff to like Indonesia Tonga Trinidad they do a lot of stuff that Galapagos yeah they have whale watching in turn Francisco yeah they oh there's a feral on people yeah they asked me to go to their fare lines we should go up there and do that I never fall yes he said that we'd love the Farallon Islands she said it's really cool hmm yeah it's a cool place down so yeah let's go yeah so they do tons of trips you guys should definitely check them out oceanic society and see if there's something that interests you guys especially that Baja trip and they all they I went to Magdalena Bay but their trips they do San Ignacio their main one yeah their main trips are San Ignacio I think ours was more of a special one because we did the whale sharks yeah and you know the sea lions and jammed in a lot of stuff in four days yeah yeah people so I think well well if everything worked out I mean I was no polish every single time something happened we're like wow we like literally check that off was good weather for the whale sharks you know got the permit man it was just it couldn't work out so I'm saying it couldn't have worked out better like everything in a hole and the food was great they cook a lot of good food down there yeah which boats they use when you got to when you're in macdaddy it was there a certain company to use yeah well it was it was red tours there but but they were good they were not we had like good to the whales yeah we had the nicest boats guys in the bay for sure there and they were painted nice yeah even the design on the bat like we look at my pictures from the drone like the bow is like perfectly like symmetric it's good to mention you use because like me and you were discussing earlier you know a lot of people think Oh bah it's like a free-for-all you know right agree it was very regular yeah it's it's highly regular there were there folks because these guys are making us are making these people are making a living you know offer these animals so they want to protect them so don't do anything dumb down there these people love these animals yeah in the whale shark zone they check they said every day they check people and they said depending on who you get sometimes they're pretty cranky and some are very they said we got the good person though he was really nice checked our permits and he said go ahead I don't even know what he said to be honest I was in the water they said to stay close to the boat well we talked to him just in case you oh you were like they let the swimmer stay in the water well they came up injectors yeah because they just wanted to see our permits Oh Photography gear sir and once we had like I had we all had our permits printed out on paper so they just that's good it's kind of a good feeling to know that they care yeah he's watching in the protecting the animals oh you know it's funny because everybody's like oh you could do it everyone no no exactly you can't do that yeah there was actually on our way out of the whale shark zone a sailboat was trying to come in there mm-hmm into the shallow waters where the whale sharks are and yeah I got and they were like you got to get out of here that's so cool and Caitlin where you're gonna go is the same thing you know they got actually got a research camp over there and right from that area they actually watch the amount of pumpkins that go out there you know it's the only a certain amount or allowed out there know for a certain amount of time so okay yeah these places are highly monitored which is great yeah it was uh it was incredible you guys I want to go down there and like stay down there for all of the I don't want to watch the gray whales except for April May here it's not even like watching the gray well do you want to watch some killer whales eat the gray whales the same whale you touched might get concerned no I know it l know it I don't really like stuff around his blow holes had some mark out if that baby gets it here I'll know it he yell I crying serious dilemma if I go down there and have an incredible experience and then I'm on a whale watch trip like two weeks later yeah like I was just petting this baby Slater so now you're in the exclusive club you're obviously you take pictures and when you put up that picture of people touching a gray whale you're gonna get those people go why are you bugging those whales what am I gonna tell her I don't think I'm gonna put it out to be honest really for that reason yeah cuz someone already wrote me before I even went down there and they were like don't touch him leave them the heck alone but they said other worse words mhm and I just was like you know what like these whales now I've been there so yeah exactly they were 100% like seeking out the boat setting their head on the boat they were pushing the boat you know and they want and they had there were sideways they you need your hands mmm I mean it's like and if they didn't want to be touched they could they would they would pull away like there was I think the one let us touch it and the other one you know it didn't ever put his head up that much exactly head in the water yeah they want to be touched you know yeah they definitely yeah I always tell those people just go there alright that's all I say yeah it even like I on her boat you know what he said he said don't touch them like he was like don't touch them you know until it's something and like you know you can tell when it's like the feeling mm-hmm like you should reach out and pet this way mmm-hmm because and he was basically saying like you know be very like it was his speech wasn't like a very respectful speech well and I thought I've went that way he said it was basically I was like okay we're not gonna touch these animals but then like you know once they come to the he wanted you to realize that when they come to the bow and don't reach out for these yeah when there's four feet away don't have someone hold your feet and like reach out it was like wait so they're rubbing the bow yeah exactly yeah so I know something that we haven't talked about yet what's that I didn't talk about how they felt when I touch them oh yeah go for it how did they feel to you actually won't talk about somebody else first yeah I know we always talk about how they're mammals and they're born with hair but it gets rubbed off mm-hmm I never thought about where it would be on them but the gray whales these were full-grown gray whales and they had a hair on their chin yep yeah and like me not quite as much but yeah they're like in those little dimples there yeah so yeah and so my shots you can see is like clear a little cool stiff hair yeah kind of like like I guess the same they kinda look at once on the tubercles of humpback yeah yeah so anyways back to what they feel like they are soft squishy and bumpy and it's kind of hard to explain use my analogy I always tell people I feel like that like a hard-boiled egg you feel like you don't want to press because like you can poke into it oh no I seriously like you broke like lightly rubbed across it I feel like I didn't get everything I wanted done I wanted to touch the bar cause I wanted his have so allies but instead I just touched like you know there's like indents all over the roster yeah I kind of just rub my hands across those and pulled back I did my hand my camera was art that gives you a reason to go go back oh I'm going back out of here from now on they can't pay me to say wait okay so now I need to touch the barnacles and the lice hey don't be doing what I didn't do now I did it I just can't recall it there's a video you just blacked out maybe I'll put the video on my story yeah I'm scared that's gonna happen to me I'm just I don't know I took a GoPro video now I can't remember anything I like need the the Touareg I like and what am I going from one cuz we're going from one side of the boat so fast you just like I kind of her in the leg not really she's like it's okay I actually she's like I actually hit you you did call you I saw the bruise that's hilarious yeah stepping on my drone like I hide it it was just kidding crazy yeah so it was amazing yeah jealous what else do we have I'm like almost mad every time you post a photo because I'm like what the hell I'm running out I used up all the good ones already we what happened while I was gone I know there were some news about someone that ended up in a whale's mouth yeah South Africa Brutus well I don't watch some of the interview and then I turned it off I just kind of felt bad that's exactly the website live scientist yeah I watched it on basically it sounds like he was filming it has to be this is the time of year for sardine run huh mm-hmm so he was filming in in a bait ball and kind of like lost track of his surroundings and then the Whale lunged and he ended up in the whale's mouth yeah I listened to his interview in he's like well I was right up next to the school of bait and then you know what just went black and then I felt and then he's like and then I just felt pressure on my hips and I was like two sides of the mouth right on his waist no well just kind of I guess obviously released and he probably just you know panic to get out of there but yeah you guys have to just google well like man swallowed by whales yeah I don't know well and someone's our personal one well yeah and in case we got to mention this again folks yeah it's not intentional and even if the whales not the amount of capable of really ingesting mmm yeah so Brutus whales are like really fast lungers all the videos I've seen of them like everything's really really rapid can we other whales out of the water yeah he's back like he's yeah yeah I want to know what happened to the whales baleen that's my question is like to damage all those plates and they fell out or like no is it that flexible that it just like bent with the guy's body or like what happened I bet they get bend in their mouth to you so yeah it was pretty nutty it's so funny because like we always people ask like oh the whales ever get anything in their mouth well we used to say never a person matters here we are 2019 too bad I wonder if you have like a something that had like ISO billion and he just took a picture in your mouth yeah I don't know yeah cuz he was filming he we were we were literally just talking about this like two episodes ago right but yeah we were bird ingestion yeah so what else is up happening in well that's about it right that made it pretty big and viral I went whale watching today we saw great whales today we saw great balls last week too when I went out but we almost saw back with it well actually if you guys yeah so just listen guys real quick we were all on the water today but in different parts of Monterey yeah Slater now around the same boat but Eric yeah I was at a moss landing and you know what literally this week it seems like someone turned on the the springing switch or everywhere in California yeah humpbacks we had about probably approximately ten all that makes me feel certain front of Moss Landing there is some lunge feeding there black-footed albatross numbers have been gone actually we actually saw cake counted like 12 about you know a dozen of them in the area they were actually eating what we think right now I got to look at my photos of possibly a little very small maybe three the four-foot looks like a sleeper shark yeah yeah I can probably didn't you sitting out of Monterey over the weekend too yeah we had lunch feeding weird last weekend yeah so you and I had lunch meeting like a couple days before I left yeah one time happened once but I mean God you saw a lunch meeting down in San Diego I know Scotty was saying he was like over 30 with Dominic have some crazy luncheon videos on the drone yeah Chelsea had some lunch they've all had hump see that's the difference between humpbacks in Southern California and humpbacks here they're humpbacks always have common dolphins with them mm-hmm like every time I've seen how backed into the corner we have comments lose common dolphins everywhere yeah true but they're pretty common I wish it would Oh should they would commonly find their way up here yeah but we're gonna sit out there warm a lot of food out there a lot of interactive birds on anchovies so yeah yeah there's some big bird works today that we went through that no whales or dolphins were with yeah sure to do us huge piles of fish and birds yeah spring is coming so are the whales whales are coming back the gray whales are coming back the humpbacks are coming back the killer whales are gonna be almost april exactly wow you can see all that in one day in April you could see like seriously eight to ten species of stations in one trip in April April's but if you have blue whales fin whales humpback whales you see a grey well you see killer whales and then you see a couple different like a mixed pod of dolphins hmm boom yeah they don't have a mixed pot actually wait a few days ago yeah the boss they have Rizzo's northern right whale dolphins and the white sites together that's pretty phenomenal yeah you know what you guys I want to count the exact number of times nor I would be impossible that northern right whale dolphin show up to Monterey Bay this year have they come yet since I've been once since this year's I've only heard one report this we heard one two we never were I think we were headed down to him then we actually okay so two reports this yeah anchor City said Danny hey baby me and Danny actually had like five the other day we had one come at the boat so yeah we're already losing count for one say four or five maybe how about just how many times I see them how many times have you seen them cheer you guys laugh but I'm gonna become adult the northern right whale dolphin whisper you better cuz I like them they're my favorite I wanna get them tail walking in front of the boat tiny little flukes yeah they like so on and I wanted to do it backwards too so I can see the underside of their belly with all the pattern yeah one day one day yeah yeah I just want to see him you know porpoise a little bit yeah alright it's cool too well so I'm excited for spring to come oh yeah like after you get your grade well are you going there this year no no I'm just gonna go next March yeah yeah so it would've been cool if we all went this year too bad Eric's a lame-o and he's not going I have to watch the floor yeah but you've been there a bunch of time so yeah well we go live in the Baja quite frequently but the last few years I finally got to concentrate on whales yeah well how you gonna go to Baja when we got qdubs yeah so yeah we're gonna like really uh this is a year of seeing cool stuff I can sense it dude I hope my May trip to Massachusetts is good too oh yeah can I go oh it's on Margo's birthday Margo can we go on your birthday to see whales do you guarantee right whales no but I'm really hoping oh thank you guys I'm a cry on the podcast the owner of oceanic society was telling me I need to go to South Africa to see the right whales hey and I was I kept saying you need to go here you need to go here you need to go here I'm like I know don't rub it in [Laughter] they've been to so many cool places I was just in shock and awe listening to all the places they've been um one day that will be us I want to be a professional traveler sorry well watch companies but I'm on the move for traveling we've got a podcast while we travel yeah something what else you guys what else is new and the whale Mar man paper has come at pants and pretty interesting ones actually like today yeah what you see it was that one I kind of briefly mentioned to you about depression chains sounds depressing and boring but it's actually pretty cool I guess some researchers with this really sophisticated sonar or down in South America kind of checking out the seafloor bottom Eddy know this STIs little kind of chain of like ridges down on the bottom of the sea floor we're talking about way down there we're talking about about 4000 meters underwater convert that into feet kaitlin 4000 meters yeah where the heck is that uh calm out to trench towards South America that so wait so we're talking like more than two miles deep yeah thousand feet so it turns out these trenches are kind of the width and length of a certain beaked whale so that's kind of what was it yeah there's Kuby a's and they actually find that later next week that's actually they believe that these animals are going down to the sea floor kind of sifting around a little bit what are they even getting though like what yes maybe it's like sound like sort of thing that gets them like 12,000 feet you should go get high what that's a new paper that came out today you know kind of quickly glanced over that but if you guys we I think we mentioned this mailing list many times Marv man wailing Mar ma'am mailing lists and it's just the collection of that amazing papers that come out you know a few times a week and it's a great resource for you who wanted to learn too literally the latest you know in cetacean news out there and also a great resource for you younger folks who want to get into the field because they are list internship opportunities volunteer opportunities jobs all kinds of good things like that but yeah reading this paper today they think possibly sperm whales in kouhei's beat whales are theirs they can literally go down at the bottom of these deep parts and could be down there looking for for goodies and they're going literally to the bottom causing a little imprint themselves kind of like a whale snow angel 3999 and 4258 meters that is insane wait they're good what the Atacama Trench so that's like way down in South America like in Argentina how big is that trench like the Mariana Fisher but if you guys are interested reading in this yet the name of the article is depression chains in seafloor of contrasting morphology to calm a trench margin so it's a paper written by Marsh at all so do you guys know pretty new news out there about literally with hills going down more than a mile down to the bottom more than two miles to us out yeah do you guys know if the mid so the Mariana Trench is just too busy the biggest in the Pacific or is it the biggest period period deepest period jeebies period yeah close to six miles that's what I thought yeah you never know new stuff comes up all the time yep exactly I bet there is another trench bigger there actually is talk that there is a spot deeper than the deepest spot that's just that they can't even really measure it reach it or measure it yeah so that's still in the Marianas I don't think it's the heat I think it's just still accessibility and the technology they they were verified a little bit more technology they need one more app on their phone probably it's just crazy to think like what is it where do we come up with this technology we're just like how do you go what is that well yeah so this is crazy so they're referencing that the deepest dive of a Cuvier is two thousand nine hundred ninety two meters on it with a dive tag on but then they're speculating that like up to four thousand meters of beaked whales making these depressions the bottom yeah what they're saying is the the depressions are literally like their size they're about the squid they're about a meter and a half wide and they're about eight and a half meters long the length down of a Cuvier is beating well so is that a squid or there that's a rat food I left that's like hagfish that's some kind of fish or sleeper shark or something okay so whatever that is I mean what if it's a shark or something in the sand now we're now Oh both on observe at 4,000 meters steps I've seen a rat fish where was the rapid how many crustacean on a fish tail uh see they're all about 4,000 meters so they grab fish can go down before doesn't meet her oh yeah easy you down here yeah yeah yeah I belong on a fishing boat but our deepest fish and they have checked out Marianas Trench and there's actually something no there's a snail fish that can that's thriving down there well they're saying that there's several benthic octopi species down there and you know beaked whales are squid eaters so octopi is a similar cephalopod yeah so this is the latest talk there about our too deep that's what I'm saying possibly possibly some physical evidence that they're doing doing this like as you're a kid you know hey bet you can't swim down touch the bottom of the pool well these two animals looks like they're literally touching the bottom of the pool wow that's intense yeah so every week the ocean gets more incredible yeah every like three seconds bro yeah I should get a job I know I love it working on the ocean oh wait speaking of getting a job in ocean I've gotten this message two times in the last listened to we episode eight eight eight how I came well you are interested in working towards working in the ocean listen to episode 8 of the wheel nerds podcast yeah man but uh the long and short of it is just trying to get your foot in the door somewhere yeah somewhere knowledge here somewhere or pick up a job that's like in an adjacent field like you know working office even though you want to be on the water something like that yeah well you're not gonna make a lot of money doing it but you do a lot of fun stuff sometimes it's not about the money yeah until you need to pay your bills and pay rent so we covered my trip to Baja we talked about the guy that swam into the breeders whale's mouth we talked about this Cuvier beaked whale crazy depression dive bring times on the horizon for the California coast go well watching ya go well watch ya you guys come whale watching come on good right now it's popping all kinds of great sightings pretty much every barber in California long as the weather is good yeah so you guys have another starting I feel like the weather is getting better we haven't had his break in the weather do you look at the future he's sad he's depressed now that we've rained on his per have a little bit early rained on his parade there's a little bit of rain next week but Tuesday what I wanna know is is the wind ever gonna stop in Monterey yeah we just are blowing it up striction wind blows I'm gonna get really big fans that go absolutely blow it that's why I tell people all the time like either turn that fan off on the ocean to point your fan out there all right you guys well I think we covered a bunch for this podcast thank you guys so much if you made it this far episode 12 which is awesome I'm glad to be back from my trip down there and to continue doing these podcast to you because I'm tired of you having so much fun without us yeah sorry I can't I'm gonna do it again you guys it's my goal to have as much fun as I can in the ocean make sure you guys follow us on Instagram it's well nerds make sure you guys send us some DM of topics we didn't post anything I was gone none of us supposted anything over the last week but I posted on the story once you did okay so we'll get back on it yeah thank you guys yeah thank you guys and uh you know keep those questions coming if we didn't answer your question this one well we kind of did you know trip right here but I am those of you who asked me personally I have been writing them down so I'll try to get to them as soon as possible so keep those cop topic suggestions coming yeah maybe what we can do is do like a trip report mm-hmm and then do a questions today so maybe that's how we can break it up so maybe next week we'll do questions yeah oh I was thinking maybe we can add another day again I like doing them but we do run out of topics quick well maybe in the future maybe in the summer because it's someone to take more trips yeah I'm down send me wherever well so in the summer we're definitely gonna have more to talk about oh yeah and the killer whale season so we can do like trip report question trip report question yeah we'll keep you posted if we're gonna change the the posting schedule but for now we're doing once a week all right you guys thanks for listening thank you thanks for listening everyone

hello everyone and welcome back to the wheel nerds podcast this is episode 13 my name is Slater and I'm here with Eric and Caitlyn hey everyone hello and today we are talking about some stuff that we saw on the water this last couple days what did we see we had lots of humpbacks I started returning to the bay which is awesome it's a nice change of pace from watching the most exciting gray well or exciting we love them all the great we had great gray well I know 18 yeah I still like him and you should like him extra a lot I do I like theirs elegant the weather was beautiful today though so you got some nice footage of gray whales yeah and it's much rain again tomorrow rain yesterday - we had like 4 good days than one day of rain and then which I guess yesterday was nice on the water I just rained for the morning yeah I wouldn't have wanted to go though I hate when it's rainy I enjoyed today that's all that mattered typical lake tuna so but Eric and I we're on the boat what three days ago yeah and we saw a lone killer whale he's a transient or Biggs killer well you guys want to explain about the Biggs what that means yeah who it is yeah yeah I'll talk a little bit about that in general you can probably tell them exactly who that individual that we spotted was but plain and simple here in the Monterey Bay Area the most frequently seen eco type of Orca we see is the Biggs or transient killer whale the two names are transferable because Biggs is in honor of believe as Michael Biggs yes actually you know really kind of did research out there determining that what type of eco types that we had out here he was based out of I believe it was the San Juan area was yeah I think yeah but named after him but yes our Biggs or transients are specializing in eating marine mammals so sea lions seals dolphins and here in the Monterey Bay around April we frequently see them go after gray well calves yeah so basically it's just an honor to Michael beg to to use that as an alternate name for the Eco type yeah he's one of the original researchers that really started to tell people like no these are different they do different things they look different and then you know supporting evidence with hydrophone recordings and things like that came along and kind of solidified it all and something else I want to talk about so because it was a lone male killer well I always get a lot of comments and people are always like oh my god why is he by himself he's gonna is he gonna make it oh yeah you know there's all sorts of things in that manner and what do you guys think I mean we obviously know that he's very healthy all the lone killer whales that we see here very healthy yeah I owe anything on his history like if you know his old pod sort of so it's it's a little unclear but his his ID number according to the old catalog is 49 B there is a sibling that hangs out with the 51 a pod the called 49 C and the first time the history was ever told to me it almost seemed like the mom was still around but the kids were not seen with her but I'm pretty sure that 49 is now suspected to be deceased because I couldn't even tell you the last time 49 was sighted that's all that's all anecdotal I don't actually have like there's no like public log of all the sightings and the the catalog hasn't been updated for quite sometime so that's just kind of like an anecdotal thing that I know about him but he's he's seen he's sighted in clusters so like you'll see him for a couple weeks and then he'll be gone for like months and then he'll show up again for a couple weeks and then he's gone for months yeah what's funny is we keep on telling you know we refer to him as lone you know male transients but we've yeah we've seen them numerous times kind of join up with other pods out here right that's or with each other for kills yeah several males together man yeah or their or George or FATF a nerd you know 15 miles away or 20 miles away the insiders actually had like two lone males actually get together which was quite operating the cars I've seen fat fin and load some 25 and George we've seen that back in the past we had yeah remember the one with the big notch in the middle and then we've seen in the past when Joplin was still around we assumed never saw the child I assume chop finicky yeah so yes the loner boys will get together and then also kind of an interesting situation is like liner who's part of Emma's pod he is actually his ID number I think is like 163 or something like that he's not Emma son yeah so there's kind of maybe some adoption things going on there too like 50 B hangs out with the 51 A's hmm after his mom died so it's not it's not all clear-cut how the social structure works exactly you know who I want to see again yeah that's a neat way again yeah and that's other thing is like in the springtime that's like killer whale social hour you know when there's a gray whale kill multiple family groups or like several lone males will kind of join the join the mix mm-hmm and it as far as like the lone male and survival thing goes I know people ask about that my opinion is if the male is old enough which I think fat fin might have been as young as like eight years old and they already know most of the prime foraging areas and know how to like they're pretty well socialized they know how to interact with other adult whales they're gonna be okay when mom dies but sometimes you know the calf's young like you know under five I'd say the odds of survivorship are pretty low yeah it seems like they're a perfect example is we're just talking about lonesome George you know we've got old timers at the wharf you know guys we literally are you know started working there as kids and teenagers remember seeing him answer and these gentlemen are Noah in the seventies yeah yeah yeah he's been around a long time and I I don't know if we've ever known anything other than him being by himself yeah you know I don't think there was ever documented like oh this was his mom but she died like no i always only seen him because he's a survivor so obviously they do seems like they can do well by themselves yeah and they also don't have any you know predators know exactly and they're they're totally capable of taking down prey on their own yeah it may be modified what prey they go after like maybe they only can go after like harbor seals and sea lions and they can't take down something like a dolphin but there's enough food around in this area that they don't really have an issue with it ever and I also think there's such good hunters even being by themselves yeah you're at a disadvantage but think about it's more food for yourself yeah you don't have to split it once you yeah like 60 lines to feed your family yeah a perfect look at the size of George I mean we honestly think he might be the biggest working out here in the Pacific I mean I have no doubt he's close to 30 feet and yeah Slater's photo then going towards that boat see a TENS a big boy - not in person I saw your photo had a big wavy door yeah thought maybe it was George yeah and I think another important piece is that we miss what they're doing with ninety percent of their daily life exactly like we we do not observe what they do for more than the vast majority of what they're doing day to day so like who knows maybe they're all hanging out like in Big Sur offshore together all the time and we just have no idea wanna know what's happening yeah or if not them then give me the offshore don't lie to me bro we know yeah but I probably a good thing that we don't know where that to be honest yeah let him be yeah and that's the other question I do I think that's the question I get a lot on the boat is like well are they migratory like where do they go when they're not here and it's like honestly there's not a whole lot of sighting coverage except for from other whale watch companies and like think of how many hundreds of miles are between like the next ports that regularly go out and regularly report their sightings yeah there's these huge information gaps like I can tell you growing up in Oregon and coming up through the you know well people in Oregon there's no sighting coverage there our whales could be up there all except for when they're here neighborhood make one thing to me know one thing Slater and I were talking about even talked about Kate today one perfect example is the CA 140 Emma's pot when gray whales are here they are here but you don't hear people in Southern California are north of us say hey we saw the 140s but the fifty ones we always do yeah yeah yeah maybe Monterey could be like the the crossover point they're all intersection if anyone's here Pro probably things changed to like the 50 ones may have been here a lot more frequently before we all started working here in Monterey and now it's all about the 140s and I think that the that Jagan's group was seen more often because I'm pretty sure Pat Finn used to go travel with them all the time and I feel like they saw them more often yeah I think things definitely change around and our whale population of like the ones that are really well documented are aging out and so how does the social structure reorganize after that I don't you know I don't really know we don't see them often enough to know how that's going to go yeah do you guys think that the killer whales like anyone has actually there's some stuff but it's it's nothing really super specific we kind of have ranges there are like the original catalogue that came out of central California has some offshore whales in it I think some of those yeah Salish Sea catalogs have Offshore's in them yeah they could go all the way beyond that yeah and then and there may be an entirely other subset of offshore killer whales that frequent that northern range I mean there's some hydrophone recordings but yeah I mean overall data is pretty pretty surprisingly don't go to Hawaii ever I do I do think there has been a sighting of killer whales in Hawaii in the last five years yeah no they are you'll be surprised the guys who are out at sea a lot around the Hawaiian Islands deuce yeah I think a fishing boat in fact Darin gentleman named Aaron who runs dive trips off of the Big Island he has some pretty famous photos that went around maybe about four years ago of killer whales actually eating a thresher shark over there so they do show up an area but yeah it's not as common obviously as people right no I think yeah it'd have to be some kind of you know exactly squid large yes opportunistic feeder like et Peas yes so then that's a whole nother level of complication like re TPS and offshore type are they their own ecotype like yeah what if there's like tons of different like there's got to be so many different pods and workers everywhere that feed on different things yeah like we know there is but I mean like what do you consider them you know so guys really quickly I just had to pull up some an old paper I wrote a few years ago about Offshore's I wrote it but I almost forgot but one of the Offshore's that was spotted off at dana point was matched to a sighting in Dutch Harbor Alaska so that's about 2700 miles apart yeah Wow I'd like to see the photos yeah myself I'd like independent confirmation yeah you never know there's so many different dorsal fins yeah yeah so know what but I would believe it though because there's also been sightings of transients that have been sighted here that have been in southeast Alaska mm-hmm yeah I mean that's those residents go up to Alaska and come down yeah and they come down here yeah and they go way offshore with the same into all about the food yeah so like Ken Malcolm has put these like wanted posters all over the Pacific Northwest for people to report their killer whale sightings trying to create like a communications hub he's done that for decades just thinking back to like how often are whales probably cited off the Oregon coast and all and could you even then call them our whales like we see them in Monterey in the spring when we know there's a predictable feeding event that happens but then pretty much the rest of the year they're not hanging out like they do in April in May so are they really like central California killer whales I don't even think that's the right term for that well they really do come one or two times a month yeah like just not this last year my first year here they were here well I think last three or four times a month I think last year they were here but the weather was so bad that we couldn't get out into the areas where we typically see that this year to the last two months I also think it could be a something with the just the area we're in if you really think about where the bay it is a big bay but we do have an area we just covered consistently whereas back in Southern California the bite we're literally just going up and down the coast so we kind of you know chances of seeing them I say explain a Bay where you can have everything kind of isolated and put in the bay you know yeah we got like how often are they in Carmel and weird like up in the middle of the game yeah hardly go to Carmel typically great well season which we much turnaround at Cypress yeah what's the other the were they were the other day well they we summon a monster yeah any time we ever hear about whales that ways when the santa cruz people come down mmm-hmm so yeah I bet we miss him a lot too yeah well on the bay like I think were you trying to say Eric is like there's definitely a clear like cut across the bay route that we basically never get to because it's like an over an hour drive out of the harbor to get out to the area where they would just straight cut across the band we were with the gray whales two days later they're way how much better is it when you're like way out there and you find a whale it is pretty fun like the water was very clear yeah like it was the water was answer no I mean yeah the clarity the visibility was insane compared to like where we first saw very well good morning yeah so yeah I mean there are these routes where you could totally bisect that that geography and not come in along the coastline and it is a lot shorter distance for a whale to travel and we just never get out in that same zone so they could be out there often time we just know every day I wake up and I'm like okay I'm glad you're waking up Slater especially knowing that you guys had because I've moved last year you know so especially knowing that you guys had a predation in March on st. Patrick's Day I'm like today's a day every morning today well that's the cool part about Monterey today any day could be that day yeah today could be that day yeah my mom's coming in April like the end of April some time to visit and I was like yeah but yeah so I'll be on the boat in the morning for sure every morning like I'm not gonna miss any days mom you're on your own for breakfast right now I'll see some whales I have a cold and like I don't want to go tomorrow because I don't feel well but I feel like I have to go tomorrow because I'm not gonna go live on Instagram you're gonna cry oh it's Friday ha you're working yeah yeah dude like what am I gonna do fly myself like I'll catch my drone in my backpack and just carry my Y yourself out to the bay we'll just stuff you in the bunk room until it's time seriously though hey you know what though is awesome is that we we didn't see me today but people saw them we heard the other boats see them but humpbacks are are coming in mm-hmm yeah we actually are I left out everywhere I worked out of moss today and we had probably about a dozen or so and yeah it's the bigger model sleep in the water yeah we were all yeah but yeah we had a plenty of humpbacks a lot of food in the area and didn't see any lunge feeding today but we definitely saw humpback whales circling you know flocks a bird that most likely had anchovies under him and we did have some brave gray whales cruising through the mouth of the bay today and a lot of hardware porpoise sound I don't why but the harbour ports was for me been showing really well the last few days no all the days have you and I work together this week we went up towards moss and saw hot backs and yeah we didn't go to mosque yeah today we went like the corner or something and then went straight out yeah we went over the outside ledge and then went west from there and then just follow the canyon down Slater you got to show your to like report this footage oh I deleted it okay like 20 of them yeah that's cool I oh my god I'm staring at my drum Ike I'm like oh look at this hardcore bitch I'm like oh it's coming towards and I'm seeing a shadow come up and then there was a humpback next to the dark waters for like just like I don't know eight seconds and I did yeah and then and then I got over like the biggest school of anchovies not like ever but I mean like and I was like they're gonna lunch meat oh they're gonna lunch on this and I seriously is like oh we get a better angle and I write as I stop the flip I stop recording and right as I stopped all of them go struggle that's real it's just it's just a dark green water you know yeah it's kind of hard to gauge what's happening yeah you really are spoiled I know I only fly if the waters clear he didn't you guys don't understand he did not want to take a photo of a gray whale today I stood outside with my camera though because you never know they're gonna breed yeah but then I was like it's cold and then we came upon us feel well either yeah that I'm like then we came up on this group of gray whales way on the outside and it was like three or four wheels we thought and then though it was like two whales maybe yeah maybe two whales yeah and then Slater is like well I guess the water is nice so maybe I should fly and the captain are like yeah you should fly he puts a drone up it's seven whales happen to us twice today because we're following this group of two is our first encounter uh-huh and we were like oh we're gonna leave the area after this last surfacing for came up together we're like really this whole time it's been four yeah we're just all out of sync from each other we saw a lot of groups today yeah they did more than 15 because a lot of whales that were surface yeah we we had a lot of like just lazy cruising gray whales you know one of the skipper told me today which actually I think I agree with him he said southbound you know like they're feeling like they're full of energy they flick a lot they're you know going down to the party northbound they're like trying to conserve energy and just get up to the feeding ground so they stay at the surface and don't really fluke yeah baby hardly saw any fluking whales they were just kind of cruising below the surface but then also I feel like you see a lot more breaching it's fo the northbound but mainly for like the the mom and baby pair zone like they wrote I feel like they get more active in the surf and stuff but yeah it can go both ways it just depends yeah depends on the group of whales you find you know what else we did today Eric what you guys did oh yeah we picked up a lot of oh yeah you can't like went for and and still Valentine's Day blonde was about it today is March 21st yeah there was a Valentine's Day balloon out there like a month and it's like five weeks you know what what you do because of that we should probably start a campaign to cancel Valentine's Day I mean I'm okay with that no my challenge for everyone in 2019 is can we come up with a different party favor other than balloons exactly like it's 2019 I think we could do that save the five bucks and just give them the cash because I truly believe that those balloons also were sitting on the ocean that entire five weeks since they let go the other ones too I mean they had no there was some that had no mylar left on like no really the shiny part right yeah the mylar is their coating yeah and then they so the balloon was all what Slater saying is when we picked up the balloon it just looked like a bag because of the metallic shiny stuff yeah no yeah well where is me what worries me is sometimes the strings are missing already when we pick up these balloons are like yeah a lot of ring is missing honestly more often than not the string is missing the 2id gaff today had no string on him and the first who did yeah I mean I've seen albatross picking out him before and that just like freaks me out because we not even like 10 minutes after that we did see albatross picking out something yeah I think it was squid but yeah like a balloon it was all cool you know why in clearish know so speaking of albatross picking at things did I tell you guys about my little sleeper shark the other day oh yeah yeah so so the other day that was that what can we see like over 16 albatross in a really tight little area and about four or five like on something floating in the water so we try to get you know close as possible without disturbing you know the birds and getting them away from the object or carcass I should say and we get a little bit closer and we zoom in have all our lenses and from what we can see out there it looked like like some type of small dark colored shark and we didn't want to you know scared the birds away from their food so we when we got back home we all looked at our pictures and turned out it appeared to be a small sleeper shark and for those of you who are big shark nerds out there it's pretty interesting because what I want to see one yeah this is only it was only probably about three to four feet long but this shark is known to get it over yeah this the shark is known to get you know confirmed lengths of 15 feet and rumors of a bomb being like close to 20 but pretty neat-looking shark guys you haven't seen before google it they live down deep to eat whale carcasses eat anything in fact they're known to eat some big stuff there composers yeah three to four feet it was a dinky little guy but yeah I saw the picture the eyes look crazy yeah the eyes are crazy yeah and then D we also got a clear shot of its tail the caudal fin and it just matches up with a sleeper sure yeah almost every season I feel like there is a sighting of a carcass at the surface sleeper yeah we had one last year a bigger one yeah I've heard about like the biggest one I've heard it was like eight feet long I live here two years I feel like every year I hear a new thing that can happen in my right mm-hmm doesn't that awesome there's so many beautiful that like the coolest thing ever hey yeah I'd see them all I can rad it's like Pokemon gotta collect them all yeah yeah there's been a lot of Albatros a lot around which is which is pretty cool swarming that's a lot today yeah that's warming up yeah there's really yeah and slowly and I'm slowly starting to see nettles show up - uh-huh today this morning I knew he's gonna come right by the boat so I jumped out of the wheelhouse you know and I pulled my key turn my camera on hit landscape was on what you're saying a little bit out of it people knew how many times I've pulled my camera in had one and then your battery died today - yeah but I knew it was dying I let yeah I saw that and sometimes every drop of that your memory card - yeah but now I gotta make their case I like the most unprofessional professional photographers when it comes to being organized but if it's something if I know like you best believe killer will season I'll be prepped and ready you'll be ready together so we got should we not call it killer well season um I mean everybody around here does so maybe kind of it's like a little season spring season right yeah how about that time change I like it don't light up more daylight yeah playoffs so when I get up in the morning to get to work it's dark which is lame yeah I got up at like 6:30 7:30 today yeah this ain't really 6:30 I don't think so well doesn't matter towards the summer we can probably pull off three while watching trips and sedges - yep pretty soon Memorial Day weekend is when the three days start I like that five o'clock trip though the sunset trip yeah I had some pretty good serious from working the boat all day but it is a really nice trip we've had humpbacks breaching and sunset before a really good like sunset I went on mana I guess okay so usually I leave you know somewhere in the mix okay so that I remember the end of last summer I was on the back deck and I was like you guys we're leaving this way else is probably gonna breach it but you know what I really want to get that for some reason I can't get ever again is like a group of six or more lunch meeting humpbacks at sunset it's no no but we get a lot to ask for so we'll never know my god I want like a lot how about that first yeah I don't never happening in a nossa the files at all time how about that first summer when I worked at Discovery and it was like the sky was on fire red and that whales were lunch meeting I went on I was in the shop and I just like went on the boat cuz I had a feeling it was gonna be good and that was well before yeah 14 of them watch me at the same time all the way until sunset that was 2015 that fall was really excellent I haven't had a day so like every other year so this year is gonna be the year oh I bet it is if we already have known about how about lunch feeding everywhere California has had humpbacks lunch meeting man and like okay explain this to me you guys they're like 15 hop acts in San Diego and their lunch feeding on anchovies like why can't our water be blue like that because we have this thing called Weiner we have a lot more wind yeah it's still affair especially you're around Moss you're gonna get that ok Bellhorn and Riverrun ah don't be that's like exactly that's like a one-off thing cuz the reason why their water is clear is cuz it doesn't have nearly as much phytoplankton yeah and so they only get it as a special treat whereas we get it all the time yeah maybe I should go back to a special treat Yeah right I would die I can't I already tried six months six months and Margot was like you look sad I was like I know she's let's move I'm actually depressed Slater has seasonal affective disorder but about whales yeah for sure great well effective too so every every like right when it comes to you like right right February's are freaking out and then like March comes in like it's been good like that yeah they're showing up yeah the weather's calmed down a little bit yeah it's when you don't go well watching for one whole week straight that you're like wow then you start taking pictures of your dog at the beach and then you're like this isn't even doing it for me yeah raining too so then you're just sitting inside thinking about all the times you hit all the good times you had on the boat that's well that's why I've learned I've been so good at finding salamanders out here because go get your organ macro like a fish island yeah so I've been finding salamanders is here never thought I've ever find because of all the time we've had all the rain - all right do you guys want to compare animals - oh yeah animals to other things yeah yes so I actually got a one of our listeners Antonio thank you for the question once again but he you know here's this always talk about the sizes of all our animals out there but it's not like everyone has you know a giant ruler out their driveway and stuff like that so he's wondering what everyday objects can you compare some of them more popular whales - so people can kind of visualize what how big these animals really are so me and Caitlin have already you know this was a really good question that's actually a question that even kids used to ask me at the aquarium at the aquarium we did take the time to take a rope that was approximately you know a hundred feet long and show kids this is you know this size a blue whale can get me then halfway down we had like a not to let them know okay this is about 50 feet this is how big you're you know how big you are your you know gray or your humpback whale could average but you know still that rope is still kind of you know you know so hard - they're pretty yeah so everyday objects as Antonia asked would be a better example so me and Kate we came up with a blue whale blue whales you know official 98 unofficial at 110 your NBA sized basketball court guys a basketball court is officially 94 feet so a blue whale is as big as a full size yeah and then what was the other whale but I always say on the boat for humpback whales and gray whales is they you know you're looking at gray whales average 40 to 50 feet humpback whales 45 to 55 feet a school bus is about 45 feet long so that's a good good comparison of how long those whales are or a city bus they're they're usually pretty similar in length what I like to tell people about the calves though is I Drive a Toyota Tacoma truck I actually had to have it weighed one time it's about 16 feet long and it weighs 2,000 pounds so a newborn gray whale or humpback whale calf could be the exact same size as my truck your tricks that light yep Wow a little baby truck those yellow school buses you guys traditionally see yeah those are known to be about 45 yeah it parked my truck next to a bus that would be like a full-term great well feed it and then to a baby that's a good way to put it yeah now we gotta go find a bus at your truck and tickets I'm gonna take a picture for reference yes and it is life-size in the killer whales are life-size yeah yeah killer whales are a lot bigger than you think they are and then at the Aquarium of the Pacific if you're a Southern California they actually have a blue whale life-size model with a calf next to it the blue whale is 88 feet that's a female that they have a replica and then if you walk up the stairs and right next to it you'll see the calf next to it and I think the calf was made up to be about 22 feet and those are all life-size accurate anatomically correct you know models there so if you have ax those areas either the Monterey Bay Aquarium or according to Pacific you will see accurate life-size models of these animals another one I use for dolphins for smaller cetacean species like harbour porpoise Pacific white-sided dolphins common dolphins is especially common dolphins Pacific white-sided dolphins in northern right whale dolphins I say they're a little bit larger than the average human so there's six to eight feet long you could easily say that there are human beings that are six feet tall right and they weigh two to three hundred pounds the Coast Guard considers the average American to weigh 180 pounds so they're just a little bit larger than the average human and then harbour porpoise like are even closer to average human size they're four maybe five feet long and again way maybe 200 pounds so that's another good one to kind of compare for people that if you laid down on the beach next to like a dolphin that had washed ashore you'd measure up pretty close to the same length as them yeah that's true yeah some pollen those average size balls sorry during the summer when we have the lunch meeting humpbacks and we have like you know ten humpbacks there and a thousand sea lions it's really cool to think that all the sea lions are like 5 to 6 feet yeah they're kind of like a person size yeah they're like and then you see like you know six of Oh more like next to a humpback yeah you know down the side of it that's a good one to provide some context for like how big a whale is you're like wow that sea lions not even as long as that whales Edie yeah yeah yeah another resource I thought of especially appear from this area that long Marine Lab and Santa Cruz actually has that blue blue whale skeleton outside and then right behind it more towards the the cliff in the ocean there's a a smaller gray whale skeleton that you guys can also step up to to see how big these animals really are and unfortunately you know remember how this summer I just you know we see all that those strandings and you know the sea sandals on shore but you know that's like your best chance sometimes they actually get up to these animals and and figure out how big they are like that common dolphin that was over there by lovers you know that's just the common dolphin and you know you in the water like oh that looks like it's only about four feet long and I lay down next door there's like and it's like oh you know it's my size I'm only what five seven to build yeah yeah and then you can also kind of compare animals to each other like when we're talking about killer whales attacking gray whales the killer whales are about the same length as the calf maybe a little shorter by the time the calf reaches Monterey and the killer whales typically outweigh the calf mm-hmm the males do I don't know if the females do but you know they're going after an animal that's basically the same size as them being defended by an animal that's twice as long as them yeah this reminds me of remember this we're talking about oh yeah units of measurement people use like yards feet gallons and then like you could listen to David Attenborough he's like 10 swimming my buddy my buddy yeah my buddy Mike who's created a lot of and helped to produce a lot of documentaries out there about wildlife he's saying that how you you always hear like David I'm bro and they're reading a documentary going it's as big as full school buses and yeah it really is a realistic way to you know units of measurement elephants also elephants football fields oh yeah it kind of gives people a general idea of the mass of it actual weight and then people say like a blue whale heart is the same size as a Volkswagen bug yeah yeah but yeah you could drive a car into the blue walls now but yeah you're so fascinated with that Slater was flying the drone over lunge feeding blue well I'm sure we've talked about this before one of the other episodes but Slater leans over to me while watching this blue whales gaping jaw open is like you think you could park a car and there I was like I know you could so yeah all these resources out there that you see in the everyday basis can help you out or hey if you're not curious do what they you know said about what we used to do with the kids at the aquarium take go to Home Depot by the 100-foot rope lay down and go wow yeah you know another fun thing I like to do depending on which vessel I'm on and and this doesn't apply all the time but like the Chivas KO which is one of our whale watch vessels at Discovery the humpback whales tail fluke is just about as wide as the back of the boat the back of the boats like 20 and a half feet and imagine the humpback is actually the size of a Tabasco yeah and then the length of the Tabasco is just over 63 feet and that's like the biggest recorded humpback on record so it's nice to also put the context for like when I say the tails as wide as the back of the boat people look at the back of the boat and they're like what I'm serious imagine if you like 70 feet like a fin well you know and breaching that'd be amazing it would be really cool I mean I'm sure they'd be able to breach to because they're just their bodies are built over them yeah yeah they have yeah they're definitely built yeah yeah very wide flukes for how long back out there yeah I think so yeah some of ours are huge you like see him come up and I don't think so but there's two being slaver and watching every time we seem like it's them and it's like you just look I'm like those are some big girls the one that was describing to you a probably like Colleen and a puzzle compact yeah big old ladies the humpback - Adam so you named it chalkboard huh it has rake marks like head to toe no our whole body has like his scuff marks are like rake marks Reiko oh is it maybe how big was it was it a younger one there was one here like a calf like three seasons ago that was completely chewed all right Adam we're gonna stock Instagram right now buddy and see your whale here yeah it might be gone already it's God Adam where you at okay well now it's on he posted on happy well so chalkboard California I think it wasn't for it's a first fluke idea on there oh wow that means seen so he named it first happy well name good luck chalkboard ups you soon yeah so but you guys have to find it maybe I'll post it again but it what's it called it had rake marks all over the torso of the flu I'll have to see if I oh my gosh it's kind of a tall order for me to get dig through my archives of photos but I have a photos of that calf from that season three years ago that was just like completely it was like it almost looked like a zebra it was so covered in rake marks all over its body so they must get away I guess yeah that one definitely was like eaten by several killer whales and still go I wonder if what happens is they just mess with it so I totally think so here yeah they know it's probably not worth the fight you know and yeah they just mess with it I mean I see them get adult gray whales rolling around just fun yeah you know yeah and then sometimes they tortured they're kind of like cats do you know what torture the mouse and let it run around we need to yeah should be washing the gray whales I keep wanting to go to the humpbacks last couple days I've been singles go tomorrow yeah we should be watching the ship you watch beyond the canyon because yeah it could be a predation you're gonna lead us to the killer was yeah alright I've changed my game plan that we're gonna graze all right they definitely love it when you tell them what route to take for the day I just simply suggest alright well Caleb's leaving to Baja to go see gray whales in the lagoons I can't wait so we could hear about that and a week or so yes I guess we're gonna have one more episode before you leave or we gotta court it we're gonna report it and then date and you'll remember everything fresh and I'll be like crying because I'll be so tired but it not be so no but you'll still have a lot of energy to I will I will like not be able to sleep until I get the story out like you guys nice all this stuff can you bring see stuff right bring a junior the whales might not be there in the two days you'll be when you get there yeah they're for sure gonna be there look how many wells are coming by today don't worry we're leaving already no I I people just wrote me today and they said oh just Sarah last week so they were there and mala my trips have been literally the last week of March into the first week of April so you're fine yeah okay yeah okay you're gonna see that and then you're on your way back gonna stop and try just women to kill the yeah we'll see our schedules pretty tight because it's such a long drive from the pause I may just have to do another trip to go see the whale shark so one of the people the guides on the boat that we were with in my trip to Baja her sister jumped in with orcas in Mexico inside to see a Cortes or what yeah somewhere a crystal clear blue water they just swam around her check them out like they were all like just in like like bathing suits you know with just Mossad and I was like wow they're all there like if I get to touch one gray whale and I get to see a frigate bird we're good oh yeah I don't know like you're for sure gonna see for ya there I saw him over there just hopefully they're still there when you get back but it's also gonna be like not well full moons today so it's still gonna be like kind of bright out at night if I could see a whale at nighttime I would be so happy in the dark speaking about Caitlin you know what's you know what's funny cannons the camp you're going to chemo where you know I usually go we actually asked them what clima means and supposedly it's the light that is created when a gray whale breaches that night from the bioluminescence oh it's like a slang for decisive yeah so when you go to ask them about that kind of like to boss goes like a rain squall that they only lose that term on Baja or something yeah so ask about the original name queen yeah I was eating at a restaurant at the wharf down here and I was there for a birthday and there was moonlight coming across the bay and I'm just thinking one day there's got to be a humpback like that to something so what you're saying is every time there's a full moon we should go look for whales from land yeah probably okay I'm in well it's gotta be in a spot where you get like it's gotta be just going on the mouth oh dude okay no here's I know the place like lovers point cuz then the moon's coming up from the east on the other side of the bay then it makes this nice light on the bay you're looking at seaside you know yeah lovers point so catch yourself at lovers point and PG on the next full moon catch me at love it's raining how's that yeah but or like off Wharf - if their lunch feeding over I like yeah yeah if the tides the tides what's up with that there was what I for the first year man imagine oh my god we messed up last year there was bioluminescence last year we could have gone to the beach and probably watched them in the bioluminescence from the tides hotel what were we doing I went kayaking in there yes well hope you heard about that of course in the next day Eric and was like Eric fell in the water everyone Eric fell on his kite should have thrown the kayak in front of me I was paddling so fast I went right over that kayak enrolled it was not what happened because the Kraken I was going towards the dock and the kayak would he had to the kayaks tied up and it was in front of me and I was like oh okay boom I flipped right out in Mexico when we were waitin bioluminescence at the lagoons and claim it Eric no I haven't seen it there which is weird to talk about but I haven't seen it I want to see it the beach over there is neat guys a lot of whale bones carcasses of things there's lots of fossil beds over there so you're gonna have fun just walking around the water literally two days after I leave their next tour group that went through the same people in Mexico that I went with they they took a lot like a hike and they went saw a bunch of gray whale bones mm-hmm and I was like well she's like oh yeah just a 40-minute war forty minutes yeah boat rides little you might want to do that Caitlyn actually when you go to keema ask him about the flat there's a flat area over there Kyle most like it's like a salt flat that has a few gray whale bones at so head on and there's literally turtle shells ribs just laying around your campsite over there it's amazing cool yeah sort of shark or something yeah and then there was a bird there was a bunch of bones all over the speech I think fishermen leave the bones there probably yeah sadly there was a really small hammerhead shark there too could have been bycatch or something yeah yeah definitely could uh but we did see tons of frigates in that spot to their frigates all over yeah is there like a mangrove or something over by where I'm going yeah and Kohima there actually is the mangroves just ask him about them if the tides right they'll be able to take you in there oh yeah mangroves and in fact the mangroves at clima the middle of you know baja area that's the the northernmost mangrove you know patch that you got okay yeah yeah it's they're more common down so yeah so the ones that and that's a nice northernmost you know mangroves yeah and they're really important to me if you really get into it they absorb you know a lot of the bad stuff out there for for us so great just kind of like you know like eel grass and kelp beds and things like that it also kind of protects certain areas from erosion also yeah members are born you know unfortunately we only got em you know in the southeast but they're pretty amazing habitat kind of like our kelp forests yeah Slater's scrolling through his photos from Baja in front of us it's not even very nice of him at all it's not even fair I'm thinking I'm thinking I should post another whale shark photo do it there please you got so much great well short underwater well short video that one oh yeah you haven't posted that yeah I've been watching it I have the sneak you were blessed with good water quality too because every time the last peoples I've seen when people it hasn't been that you keep on saying it's not clear but it's clear didn't those people okay be really cool even the guys that go into yeah you know they don't get that clear of what about you you got some decent water that you're in your trip that's pretty cool yeah no it was clear it was I don't know it was clear in person it was on the camera yeah well cuz the camera picks up all those little particulates more than that scatter yeah yeah but the drone I mean that's the thing with a drone it just cuts through and like makes it look like it's you know in this you know yeah it doesn't have the same glare at an angle you're looking straight down on it yeah so yeah it makes it look a lot nicer than it is well it was amazing it was like perfect weather yeah so yeah well you guys we just made it to 49 minutes in 11 seconds this is a good podcast I'm excited this is a good one yeah we have some more topics that I think we'll talk about on the next episode but that might even come after because I think what we're gonna do is woof Caitlyn come fresh and we'll put a positive Tuesday yeah will push our posting to Tuesday the second for episode 14 and yeah so we had some people come on the boat over the last couple weeks I missed them both times yeah thanks whale nerd fans for being out on the boat we appreciated that it was fun to meet you all in person and yeah I was coming up on you know really good sighting seasons I know some of you braved some gnarly whether to come whale watching so if you can come again sometime soon you know that's probably why I was it there yeah that might be why Slater miss you both yeah I'm trying to think yeah I think it was raining that day but yeah if you guys are a listener once again yeah thanks for you know coming by and saying hi to us as you can see myself and Caitlin Slater don't bite so yeah I feel free to come up and chat with us so it was really nice talking to you folks and it turns out some of our fans are more than interested in whales they have similar mindset says as your fellow podcasters here so it was nice talking to you guys also on that note if you guys found us from like Spotify or pod being and you don't follow us on Instagram make sure you follow us it's at Whale nerds and send us topics questions whatever you got we like to hear it so yeah thank you so much for listening and we'll see you guys on the next episode yeah thank you all right thanks guys for listening

-

hello everyone and welcome back to the well Nerds podcast this is episode number 14 I have Eric and Kailyn here hello everyone hello my name is Slater and I'm pretty sure we all had like a freakin phenomenal week yeah heck yeah yes you had a good week while I was on vacation what do you guys want to talk about first let's talk about Larry let's have Caitlyn talk about her trip okay and then we'll talk about stop looking at my list of things to talk about this is disappointing compared to what you guys are going to talk to you okay where'd you go Caitlyn I went to Baja and I'm sick so that sounds real nice today so I petty well guys Wow how did it feel you're right I thought I was gonna poke through the skin it was weird it was like kind of squishy this is a barnacle no dank see it's in the moment you just think about like touching it real quick and that's it okay I also have short arms so when you go to Baja take a longer arm take longer arms I didn't have a camera strap on my camera and I thought I'd drop it I did but only like that around the neckline and I was like whoo I should have a hand strap on this thing this is scary so was it right did it feel like a hard-boiled egg - yeah yeah a little bit this calf that I touched was actually pretty smooth but my sister was like when she touched it she's like I kind of poked in like its head up right right by her and she was like loves getting escorted out of you think they'd all have so many holes and that's why they have all those little bumps on there what are those by the way do you guys know there's a hair fall no there's like the hair had a dimple yeah especially you look at closely if that calves you could really seen before they get like barnacles yeah cool that's weird I just thought they're like almost like reverse tubercles consider that go inward yeah cuz there is hairs all over the face like yep so humpbacks up close like that to here's all over face yeah yeah all right tell us what else to do oh you saw bones I didn't get to go to any little bone yards oh yeah there was just like bones everywhere also just like wow and you were at KU Hema right yeah so we flew until the pause and we drove for an entire day San Ignacio it was my family didn't arrive till 1:00 and we stopped in santa rosalia after it'd been dark for a couple hours because we couldn't go all the way to San Ignacio is too far and then it was like another hour to get there so I was like probably ten hours total driving yeah you think it's going to like the map we'll say seven hours but like no dude it takes 10 like there's so many trucks on the road it's hilly it's whiny you're gonna want to like stop and do the read-a-thon I'm sure we were on the same road for most of it yeah yeah ours warned people who do do the drive down there even for a short drive you know and and Baja especially the rural parts closer towards like San Ignacio and stuff like that - don't drive a night you know drive the daytime at least you know why you don't want to drive at night it's how we think it's freaking there's cows in the middle of the road we had a warning yep cows there are bakas after about like the fifth or six like close animal on the road and then a cow straight up walking down the middle of the highway we were like okay we got to pull off in the nearest town and ask for a hotel was it just you and your family driving yeah yeah it was me driving after County I'm walking down the highway and I was going really fast I was like yeah we gotta get yeah so cows narrow roads trucks you know I was in a like a van I guided like we had a bunch of vans with us right yeah yeah but we got to San Ignacio a day later than we thought but the people opinion we were super cool they credited like the night that we missed and the trip that we missed towards other days like it all shook out in the end it was it was perfect the weather was pretty windy most of the time actually like there's a little window in the middle of the day two days where it backed off but even what you see like where you're loading on the ponga at camp is not what it's like out where the whales are and it's only like a 15 minute boat ride and you're like what do you mean it felt like it was it was calm where you'd let it in the boat at yeah yeah yeah yeah the last trip we went on it was like flat calm by the pond guys and we were like oh sweet yeah let's get one more trip in before we go home we got out to the whales and it was so rough we couldn't even get there I was like oh my god what did we do so were they technically in the lagoons whoever they like outside of it the most of the time they were in the lagoon and they were in like the border area where they have to stop and ask for permission to go inside the reserve there was a few times where there was whales like further in from the reserve and you're not supposed to watch them when they're further inside I guess one of the captains told me yeah but the second day they started to move further out towards the open ocean and one of the captains was like this is the time that means they're leaving soon the moms are getting the babies ready to go in the open ocean and then the third day they were like they were in the bar like in the bar crossing rolling around we still got really friendly whales but it was like we're also surfing your first trip you didn't have friendlies know we had whales like coming close to the boat a couple times but we didn't like pet them because you weren't splashing yeah I'm telling you dude the other boat was splashing and we weren't and we were getting so it was interesting like some boats were like crinkling an empty water bottle under the surface and some boats were splashing somewhere like singing to the whales you saw people singing the whales yeah the captain is singing oils yesterday well one year we actually had a lady than another paga we saw her she had her she's hanging overboard her face was like four inches from the water and she was like yelling at the whales and then my career was like a hare try it try it I kid you not I did it I started making a random sounds into the water and know that four inches away from the water and stick my head in the water but the will start popping around us is pretty funny oh yeah so I thought that weirdo was weird but and I look like the widow after that but ya see all the things cuz at one point there was also like some adults that were like courting each other and like what we came over and we're like whoa they like stopped and I was like I don't know did we screw that up or like were they done so that was kind of weird but it was definitely really cool like oh my god it's just crazy like how they're staring at you well it's big it's insane like even when they weren't friendly like they would just like pick their head up and look at you and you're like oh yes by Hobson yeah but also the calf's just like throw their head up when they're close to the boat so they can look at you and it's like oh my god like that's you have them like on one side of the boat like today they're like tail up one side and head on yeah yeah so crazy yelping there yeah oh my gosh the moms like you don't really appreciate how big your great whale is until you have that close to you you realize it makes me wonder you yeah let me lift you dude you could feel the bubbles I thought I felt the bubbles yeah yeah and at one point one of the calves did open its mouth and this girl next to me who was like closer and could actually like see what was happening was like oh do i touch it Mel's like you can touch it and let it close its mouth or whatever but she put your hands there close fine that'd be cool to touch baleen or something I know that some people like even touch the tongue and stuff right they can scrub the time yeah yeah guess they say they like it yeah if you rub their tongue we had this one mom and calf care two days in a row that were super friendly and the mom has like a very circular mark behind her blowhole on the right side so she's pretty recognizable and her calf was really fun like always rolling around always all around the boats would go to multiple boats if there's like three boats waiting it would like take turns with the boat I think that there was we had the same scenario where it's like the same calf two days in a row yeah and they said and actually the calf had had like some prop marks on it and they were like this they seemed that this whale like loves to go to the boats like and it's like the same whale they've been seeing like a week going to all the boats so I wonder if that's a kind of the same thing you know yeah yeah I think somewhere extra friendly and then like so the last day when it was like really rough what made the trip because that we almost like I told the captain I was like can we go back closer towards the entrance of the lagoon cause it's way too rough out here and there's no whales and a whale on our way back in and start breaching stop to watch it and it was a mom I don't know what she was trying to get the calf to do the calf never liked the calf would swim fast but like she was just breaching over and over and over again and the cats sitting there oh we're trying to get away from the calf from competing pay attention and so we stopped and watched that and just like that the wind bled off and so then we were able to stay out for like the rest of the time that we were allowed in the reserve and then we went in was it like breaking waves coming through there yeah out towards the yeah and we had to get out when we had to get out past the waves like and then we can start whale watching again because like we were first watching whales and like right near the lagoon like and then we had to go out past the waves because they were like literally about to break over our ponga yeah we didn't go out past the waves but like there's like a channel there's like two spots where the bar breaks on both sides and then they're in the channel it's not as bad so we just kind of had to navigate our way around that but yeah this is pretty insane I mean it was amazing to see whales in such a small boat what else did you see other than gray whales bottlenose dolphin everything trip sometimes like friendly with the boat which was really cool lots of feeding good sea birds we saw I think even maybe a Pomeranian we saw a really big one sitting on the water really beautiful bird yeah terns pelicans I saw frigate Birds but only like driving around the paws mm-hmm and coming back down Highway one once we got like south of Laredo we started seeing them like any time there was a big bird soaring overhead half the time it was like a frigate bird you saw person Jagger's right yes so frigates and Yeager's are both kleptos right frigates are skimmers oh yeah they scan I do that yeah they're marking the mangrove that's which that was cool though I thought that and like from the kima camp if you walk towards the mangroves like to the north west I guess there's a whale skeleton outside the camp and a turtle shell there's actually a couple turtle shells you're walking around and then there's a gray whale skeleton there on the beach and it looks like a pretty big adult those ribs are pretty big the skull is pretty deteriorated so it's kind of hard to tell how big the head was but the ribs are big and the mandible is big so that's pretty cool to be able to just like walk up and be like where's Jose Osprey still everywhere around the gas yeah and they had chicks yeah yes something else and yeah we saw him like three times driving south from San Ignacio till applause that's awesome yeah there's people take trips just to see those guys pony saw those I mean we were trying to hustle to like get to La Paz before dark but I wish we would have pulled there's also not really good spot to pull off on the side of the road yeah yeah that's where I saw him was a whole driveway she kept pointing him out and we didn't I didn't take any pictures though once we got towards San Ignacio oh my gosh everything was so green and the characters were about to start blooming they had all their little buds on them it was like it definitely had been raining and how was that that drive from the actual town of San Ignacio to the lagoon is that road fully paved now or kind of it's paved the last 30 minutes of the drive is unpaved but ok quite a bit of it was paved I was surprised they didn't even look washed out because I know sometimes the flooding in the range really get crazy over there not from town to camp but like the rest of highway 1 but they did a really good job patching it wasn't a lot better shape than I thought it was gonna be like northern Baja last year was worse than all of that highway 1 in southern Baja I was actually not bad at all good yeah yeah we felt pretty safe we went to only like one military checkpoint oh you did yeah Wow well they just asked where you're going yeah I told him we were going to San Ignacio and the Sun was like already setting and the guy looked at me like good luck and then we stopped in another town to stay the night yeah I've had full-blown searches gather car open this and that but yeah yeah open the trunk in like just looked at two backpacks and it was like okay you're good thanks I think you say you're going watching they know it's going yeah he was like you guys are well crazy all right up to any weird shenanigans so yeah I was it was good it was the camp the tents were really sturdy it was really windy at night and it was noisy because of that but the tents were like really weatherproof which was nice and I heard you got an updated cow calf count right yeah there was 21 pairs when we got there and probably another 10 to 15 single whales and this year there was a lot of whales that looked really thin which is a little bit concerning yeah actually the researchers were there that had been working in those Gammons Lagoon and San Ignacio and the Sunday before we got there or I guess that day when we were flying in they filmed live with BBC from scammin sliggoo and they interviewed one of the researchers who was finishing up her work and said Ignacio when we were out at the camp and she was staying at the camp too so she like let us watch the episode with her because she wanted to show the boat crew before I didn't live in Mexico so she wanted they let her record it then she got to screen it for them and we were in there eating dinner hang out watching yes sure so that was really cool yeah she she doesn't have a conclusive answer as to why the whales look so skinny but it's probably related to oceanographic changes the last few years I mean we have the warm water blob we have remnants of an El Nino and that's not unusual in the 9899 El Nino the following year in 2000 there was a lot of whales that looked really thin and then actually stranded during the north bound migration but the population recovered was kind of a normal fluctuation thing so we'll see what happens but we saw some really thin whales you can see like behind the blowhole it was like caved in and then you could see their spine which was kind of sad and it sounded like they'd been seeing whales trying to feed in the lagoon oh yeah like I saw I went from the drone I saw like mud blooms from them like and I saw one of the whales let it go down but I also saw the calf let mud go out of her mouth yeah yeah they said they've seen some of the adults trying to feed seeing skinny whales kind of gives me an idea maybe why we're having so many wells like LA Harbor Long Beach areas having those whales actually spend some time in the harbor you know eaten so yeah food one of the skipper's out of Santa Cruz also said he's seen the same gray whale feeding off of Capitola for like a week yeah they named it already do they call it happy right quick to named whales in San Francisco Bay has also had numerous humpback I mean gray whales hanging out in there yeah so we'll see we'll see what happens what if the gray wolves are at their capacity and they're just gonna start being a residence all throughout like the west coast that'd be cool could happen I mean I guess they say there's just not enough nutrients in the water and they're like mud here but well the other day I was at ACS San Francisco meeting I talked to one of the gentlemen from golden gates and I was asking him hey have you kind of tried to ID those gray wells inside the bay because I'm just wondering and maybe for our Pacific Coast feeding group is expanding southwards which there's talk that they are yeah not just organ wells like we used to assume well yeah now we're gonna be passing gray whales and humpbacks to get to more huh well I'm glad you had a good trip I think I'm gonna go back next March hopefully the whales will still be there when I get there we should all go together I want to go to the other lagoons Gammons has been really a fun trip for me so that's a lagoon you should definitely try yeah and you know why I applaud the Taylor family they were really hearty and they said they would do it again so that's that's a good sign for me it's like even the not die-hard whale nerds were like yeah we can do it again after long car rides and long flights home and my mom just cracked me up the whole trip like you guys know how I'm like oh wow this is awesome like about everything my mom walking on the beach every ten feet Wow look at this shell Wow look at this like every two hours we're walking on the beach and every five feet my mom was like oh my God look at this oh my God look at this I was like well this must be where I get it from so pretty was it well there's lots of other like little bones just really shows in turtle shells yeah and then the beaches are covered in shells like just everywhere and there's all these piles of shells - yeah that's the polish they actually did have a shellfish industry there so that's why you'll see piles of shells in the middle of nowhere out of the desert the fresh clean shells yeah are actually piles of shells from the shell fishmen but that area especially further inland you might have when you were in chemo you might have heard about the land tours they do yeah there's actually there were a lot of natives in that area and some of those piles that are more older shells that are kind of not flattened there be high piles are actually mittens they're actually like basically a ancient kind of kind of like a landfill way to eat the shellfish and they actually yeah I mean some of it like when the on the areas were like the beach is eroding yeah I'm like it looks like these piles of shells have been happening for a long time and there are a few fossil beds in that area too yeah yeah there's lots of yeah there's definitely lots of shells and fun things like even in the rocks and all that good stuff did you see the little paw sign in the paws like in the letters no but I did see the whale tail with the bird my parents all the way from Airport yeah yeah my parents went and took a picture at the La Paz sign after they dropped me off at the airport oh they're so nice yeah yeah that's awesome I'm glad that we've all been there we can like you know because we always talk about sending people like telling people they should go do that yeah but for like Caitlyn and I we've never done it yet so now we can actually like say no you definitely yeah that yeah I always tell people take that opportunity we can you know if you're thinking about doing it save up do it there's not many places where you can get into this type of interaction with it very well yeah for sure I mean it was it was really cool really really cool definitely don't act like that around here how about those very whales today Eric oh those are great whales I'm solid just blow holes I don't we barely even saw their blowholes today 50 foot long animal I saw like four inches of them yeah I know yeah and you think about pretty amazing yeah huge Channel we can see them under the surface though the whole time that we can see their clothes you know the hair one look at that blue line in the water [Music] and literally it was like a blue-collar huh yeah it was just the water clarity that we have lately well I had some good trips before I left but you guys were just leaving me in the dust Wow we can start with that trip we had Caitlin and I had a bunch of did we talk about it no we have lots of northbound great whales and the weather was finally really nice we've had nice weather every day I feel like we're gonna jinx it Zeena make a hurricane here well be bet it's literally raining outside right now nice weather the past like seven days yes it was just one of those trips that Slater and I had there's just like so mellow it was like oh there's a couple gray whales oh wait that's for gray whales and then we got on this other group we were thought maybe was three or four Slater put the drone up it was seven oh yeah we only saw like one or two at a time so we were guessing there might be two or three yeah yeah so that was really cool to see seven great whales together yeah and then a Friday the next day we had really good groups of feeding humpbacks all around the bay outside the bay big patches of bait which it sounds like you guys have been seeing I left hundreds of dolphins led to feeding humpbacks and then in the afternoon we actually had some whales hang out with the boat for like thirty minutes we shut the engines off they weren't like spyhopping or anything but they were laying next to the bow their pecks laughing tail flopping hanging out underneath the boat we could see them on the depth sounder nice we can see I'm on the depths are so good you could see the PEC fin too because it was just sitting there okay [Music] and yeah we had lots of dolphins yeah and your boy Slater got his first northern right whale picture I know you okay you guys I've seen them before a lot of times but it's like yet to get a photo that I would even like post ever yeah Northern Railroad dolphins are not easy I don't know why they're like I make them a big deal it's just like shooting call their right feet they are kind of a big deal that's very unusual yeah yeah well it was a really big deal for me to see them I've never seen them as their own pod and that many number you know that big of a number right I've always seen him like maybe up to like 50 or 60 or 100 but at the most in there with white I definitely spread it out a big deal because you always hear me say after the trips you know it's one animal that a lot of people don't know exist so this you know it sounds like why the heck doesn't happen or something that's weird yeah I meant like a big deal isn't like I can't get a photo of it like I always make it it's a crazy thing but later whatever door the okay first off you guys it's like a 90% overcast here in Monterey all the time so when it's green water black fully black dolphins and then it's overcast there's no something I you came to see them yeah so it's really hard to guess where they're coming up now Rizzo is aglow white under the water you can see where they're coming up exactly yeah that makes it nicer well they did do something I was really cool as they stamped in a bunch yeah and then they would stop and shut off and then they would like boogie the opposite direction again chasing her vintage something wants to eat I know I was just when they all lit up the first time I was like please out of the middle of them because they seriously Kaitlyn went left right like you know laughing like it was crazy they all went opposite directions and it's just like reminded me of that one time they did that to the Pacific white-sided dolphins where they all fly out I want it and you know killer what comes out after it yeah yeah yeah I definitely thought we were gonna have a killer whale right there but nope cool trip okay rip the band-aid off just just rub it in no we have more cool trips between them in there okay yeah I saw a southern sea otter eat a bird yeah that's not even his first time seeing it no I've seen it before - yeah people are always like I've never seen that I've seen it three times that people are always saying is is that was it already dead but one time right they saw drown it right yeah I was right next to big fish girl I walked out of the office and you know where Atlantis usually parks and I hear a disturbance in the water I look down it's an otter like grabbing this grebe and you know they have this little battle and all sudden the artist goes crunched it just bites the heads right eating it yeah and the other time otters are not nice yeah people think they're like the cutest little like stuffed animal what they're not yeah so I seen that H tear and then I saw this last time and lost landing you know we're coming back in on the high spirits and we're right in between the two walls we just see this honored dining on a bird and people are like why are you so excited I'm like this is rather like you're a sick person I think I've explained to them about what was going on and how it was a rare and it does happen and you trip that trip too before you came in right you had northern rival dolphins yeah yeah I think oh you tell them about the photo you texted me and the date it wasn't office oh yeah so that day that Slater had the great northern right whale dolphin sighting you know how Facebook does that memory thing a year back exactly okay I've heard of them yeah stampede yeah just knowing about where does that same exact day a year later okay so next year on the twenty yeah well nerds on March 28th 2020 yeah yeah so hopefully next year they'll be here you know when I get there I'm just gonna be there already whatever that whatever is all the time on ilysm so that was really that kind of made my day when you texted me that and it was exactly one yeah yeah cuz it's like every year they say you see killer whales on Easter right or something like that on the 20th of April yeah and and then that kid back in Southern California we had towards you know half of the point Vicente and for the long beach boats it seemed like for a few years every January 1st yeah ever the kiddos would show up three years in a row yeah that's really like every year we'd go like almost excursion they tried to find everything yeah it was like the street it's not happening yeah I couldn't stop unfortunately they started going there more frequently - yeah last year you get 50 ones a calendar yeah speaking of killer whales yeah what state are you started from start to finish okay I was sitting down in the galley well I woke up in the morning no honestly okay we were driving right and we were headed north into the bay and then I just feel the boat flip around and so I just stood up and walked into the wheelhouse and then they both said was like how do you know were you standing outside the wheelhouse door and I was like I don't know what I was like I just saw JJ reach for the mic or the / ya know the radio and then push the throttles forward complete 180 yeah and then so then Adam was on the boat and I walked back to Adam and I was like why did why are they going so fast what's going on and I was like oh well they have dogs porpoise you think you guys are really gonna go that fast for adults porpoise has you even seen it he's like twice and I was like okay well they're really fast we got to catch them I know what we still didn't know what's going on right so then you know we like get into the area and we see like 1 2 3 4 you know dorsal fins right and then we see another boat kind of break off to the left they went to some and they said they had him as well and then the boat was on the right side of us and they went to them and basically there was like a line from like what how long it was probably more than a quarter mile or a mile yeah basically killer whales yeah and you know at first air everybody all of us on the radio everybody's like you know they're like they look like Offshore's because of the numbers they definitely are not transients or this and then like we were just going back and forth and then we're like we'll though the officers are using more dark and they're smaller and yes and like if we were just like you know we had no idea what they were mm-hmm and then sawed open sallow patches and yeah and then but then like some we've serious about you know saddle patches like because I think it was just weird because of the little wind chop that like the we just weren't getting good ideas and then like some of the males don't have an open style patch and that's like the main ones we were easy to see right and then dorsal we saw male dorsal tips that were very round yeah and then we ended up getting an ID you know from someone and yeah all the way in yeah that's pretty amazing to the point where I was like let's not cry in front of friends even though I've seen oh yeah it still it never gets old it doesn't matter if its resonance transients or it's more like you never know what you're gonna see anyone right like the feeling is just like true and we had a yeah we told the passengers like you need really take this in because you're looking at you know literally one third of it might be gone yeah I know like they were like they were on the right right and then they would go down and then they're like they're on the left another pods don't like another portion of it's on the left and like we didn't know what to do and then they wanted spy hop on the right and then we'd all go to that side then want to go on the left and like where everybody's just missing everything but there weren't that many people which is good no really have like ten people yeah and they all really appreciate it yeah really emphasize some lucky you got to go yeah there was like only ten or something yeah at the mosque and one of them actually had friends in Florida and I mean and Washington hey we're seeing this right now friends like oh my god yeah so they realized how special it was in the southern resident orcas that we saw were are known as the El pod which is basically one third of the population of the southern resident killer whales and I think there's about like 36 right it's yeah over to 36 I know because every new the new one el 124 we almost ha yeah half the population there yeah it's pretty impressive and it's really I hope our passengers really God I kept and I have to really emphasize how special it was and how these animals are something that needs to be of concern to anyone who's concerned about our wildlife out there and then they're pretty active too which is great about these races when do you remember them doing spyhopping flipping upside down slapping their tails I mean and when I saw the residents in San Juan Islands they were like every you know quarter-mile want some portion of the patras by hopping or like yeah doing something they're way more active than transient yeah it sure seems like it yeah even and I talked to some people who live in San Juans and they say that the residents are a lot more active than the transient my biggest thing is that thing that leaves you ah you know when we approach them we're kind of off the point and there were you know coming from the south I'm just like really wondering how far they way no it's gonna do you never know they might have hit in LA County or Santa Barbara or something yeah I realized there's no Sam in here and turn around it's been like since 2011 or 2012 since they've been seen in the base yeah I keep I keep getting different numbers in there some people were saying like 2003 but then some people were saying 2011 I know I know some captains that started as deckhands in the early 2010 and they saw seven resident yeah so and it was l-pod and maybe part of Cape Cod - yeah and the insulator they kind of you know look did a little Google mapping so about yeah thousand miles from an area that usually you know people expect to see them so it's pretty amazing and they go further north and further offshore as well yeah yeah so it was really neat neat experience and neat kind of like one of those um um it's just not just seen the animals but to think of the distance they travel you know yeah I wasn't worried about like the photos as much as like I can't believe I'm freaking seeing these yeah exactly you know yes when I was taken in limits I thought I was gonna have to go to San Juan Islands because I only last time I was there I only saw j-pod uh-huh so I was like you know yeah that's incredible it also speaks to the fact that when they wrote the endangered species listing for this population that including Monterey Bay is important because the whales here's your proof the whales do come down here and there and they're listing is includes Monterey as part of their critical habitat really yeah Wow yeah I know Slater's been getting a lot of comments on social media about you know could it be that these animals have realized hey salmon's kind of dwindling up here maybe we should travel a little further and then in my opinion I mean it's you know people were asking me know hey how did their condition look even the younger ones look I know the residents that well I don't seem everyday but it may look pretty healthy irregular is up and uh you know our buddies in the San Juan and and I've been Cooper Island might know better but to me they looked they were moving quick yeah they're moving so when I originally I put the drone up when we originally got to them first I thought their Offshore's you know and then that little one was like oh I saw the mom and the baby which was not lucky at the time the new one mm-hmm and they were going quick like I was keeping it down you know like the throttle down you know moving yeah they were moving pretty quick they were headed north they were out of there yeah it was neat to see him that's why at first glance and then we first initially came upon the sunny they were so spread out and lined up formation that I really used to seeing with the Offshore's was like hanging but then I realized that the dorsals were so clean none of those yeah the barnacles the type of barnacles always yeah yeah and didn't see those remember the Encounters of Offshore's back down south we always saw that and then yeah if you came close enough I was like okay open saddle yes I want to Instagram a pretty cool do you think their extreme movement patterns are an indicator of poor salmon quantities in their home areas I mean possibly possibly but I think they definitely just what they might do during the we all just happen to be at the right place yeah they used to put satellite tags on them l-pod does come south a lot and I wouldn't say that the California stock of salmon is in any other condition than the Pacific Northwest if anything there's less exactly exactly you know to me it's like I don't think it's entirely based on that and it's technically not the same in that they like right well they like yeah we get Chinook the king yeah our stocks are just it's just not the same you know California has done so much more different things with its freshwater management than the Pacific Northwest just because it's completely different climate situation really as far as the amount of rainfall you get and so and there's not I don't I don't feel like there's many hatcheries either so you know one thing we gotta do guys so we know that a lot of our faster cetaceans can move 100-plus miles a day exactly my guess he was just live before I came here to meet with you guys yeah and I was in and talking to them and I wrote but then they were changing their phone was dying and they're switching lives but I asked them I said please let me know when l-pod gets back up yes I think that'd just be really fun so I'm three days later you remember the date it can't be three days if it's a thousand miles and they only do like a hundred a day so let's yeah so let's pay attention to our buddies up north or yeah another part of the coast or something you know Oregon Coast or something yeah let's see what happens or they just come right back down here I don't want seeing you again I'm seriously about to drive up San Juan Islands like tomorrow dude come on they're watching the j-pod today yeah that day we had them actually yeah it's talking to some colleagues up north and then I go and we're watching j-pod right now yeah your life sorry I like where you like whales to let's be friends now if only I could just go back and forth like San Juan Island Monterey maybe la sometimes but mainly just Monterey like just all year long pop out to Hawaii for breeding season I need get like a plane pass like a bus pass but like a plane everyone basket out a personal drone yes you sly you around look I already have my drone license like can I just by myself around so have you gone through all your l-pod pictures yet I I did I didn't even get I think I took 30-something photos that's it maybe you guys are like freaking out I feel like a psychopath yeah you guys press the button like your cameras gonna die in a second dude so but I think it's like I was just pissed off because I didn't get any saddles like none of my photos had saddled like it was a swells that day it was pretty I don't even know what it was even some of the spy hops were like oh there's in both my hops I had the drone up which I got both spy hops from the drone yeah it was pretty cool there is rumor that there might have been additional pods there so I think we're going to go over our photos born have our buddies from up north the experts who can quickly ideas confirm that for us yeah I talked to some people today that we're here that saw them and they didn't see me oh so far they had it so far not a pod yeah I kind of want to clean up some photos and send them up north and see what they have to say yeah all the ones I sent to North instantly row have an Al part okay perfect yeah dude I literally wish you could see how many photo I have the membercard here I think there's like probably 30 and there's like a photo this morning so early cuz I wanted to use the internet to upload all thousand photos but I did also if you think about it like so many dorsals came up at one time that like you're getting a lot yeah I was counting I got like eight up at one time I was it from the drone there was like four there was like fourteen I think and one section on the other side of the boat there was eight that's awesome that was twenty you know 25 or so right there uh-huh yeah yeah so at one point you remember how they went through that school of mancho bees yeah yeah that was cool I'm getting a lot of questions like were they feeding is a I don't know I don't see anything obvious exactly it's like they stopped like yeah there's a breeze right around they just went right there and they never they never zig and zag like our Artie's they just like literally ignored anything they like went closer to each other and then away from each other yeah but seen the end of playtime after they ate and then they're like okay we gotta move hmm what's crazy thinking about it was like we were pretty close to resident like orcas cuz you know you got to stay very far away from them and give him their space in San Juan Islands but none of us had any idea in the beginning you know we know what you thought I they were yeah but once we knew everybody kind of backed off but yeah I was just kind of like it's just kind of crazy to think yeah so this is possibly like yeah once a decade type of here's this dining here about working in Monterey right like we said we always say how awesome it is I pet a whale the day before you guys saw this and I was like what the heck you guys I'm so jealous what I saw it on ER need a bird you know what I was so pumped with my week you guys had so much a lunch meeting how back from the drone I know I got like every day was blue water with huge schools of anchovies with white-sided dolphins swimming through it I've literally Caitlin while you're gone I got a video of a humpback whale with two northern right whale dolphins in a couple Pacific white-sided dolphins bow riding it then he turns over meets up with three other whales and then they lunch together I thought I was like oh I'm done like I got a tire you guys get away from me but I was sold like I was mad like I was like oh summers made already got like you know so many whales are here it feels like sorry I saw otter eat a bird did you show them back - I don't when I was out at the camp there's no cell service right so I get back in the range and I finally I see all your guys's pose and I was like dang it a really good watching then I go to the airport and I see your southern resident post and I was like I hate you guys and then I get out of the water check my phone and I'm like are you kidding me that's how it happened it's like what the other day I didn't go in afternoon and I literally sat down on a computer and it's 146 so that means they were barely leaving like the harbor because they've only they leave at 1:30 right yeah JJ calls me you guys we got 9 killer rows and I thought he was joking so I was he okay cool all right well I'll talk to you later bye and I hung up and then like two hours go by and it kind of sank him and then called back and I wait I have to go home Margo was out in Cabo yeah so I like lacy couldn't be in the crane oh yeah so I had to go home and oh my god and then I was like well you guys aren't posting any video so it didn't happen and then like I checked the story I'm discovery and there's killer well supposedly they didn't show that well anyways but still actually never mind either but no I was awful I saw the pictures yeah but was it from some people had him before us what is that oh nice Erik just made it on the news you guys right yeah you Thomas outdoors yeah out there yeah pretty exciting stuff I mean a lot of people get really worked up about southern resident in general but then when you see them in a place like Monterrey it's like I'm sure you guys as phones are blown out it's how they feel in Newport Beach when seven humpback whales show up or something because it's just not normal to see that many numbers or like a Brutus whale or like ET peas yeah you know I mean see like for us to get southern residents way down here is insane super super super cool wow what an incredible week so rare stuff can't happen in Monterrey all the time every day but it makes it for like the whole January in February when we didn't go away like what should we do make a podcast yeah all right well we made a podcast and we just all had an awesome week yeah sorry we had so much cool stuff that we saw we didn't even need questions yeah we didn't need any question about all the whales we talked we talked so much I saw artery the bird and Eric saying that like it's the coolest thing you saw week but he literally was still so amped when he walked in the office this morning resident yes yeah it's like hey I know I figured we're going to talk it out on the car ride last night to pick you up dude also tired yeah big great we caught up fun stuff happening oh I forgot to not April Fool's Adam I never said April Fool's I thought all day today I was like hold on they're breaching the resident to be like what and we can actually talk about our April Fool's stuff because technically when this thing broadcast oh yeah yeah so should I talk about mine all right you guys well I'm not gonna let it go morning today I'm getting so much feedback thank you guys so much for listening hope you enjoyed this podcast make sure you guys follow us on the well

you listeners I've been meeting a lot of you in person it seems like love you have actually been like kind of a listening to our suggestions especially you younger folks and wanted to get into the field they're running to a lot of you at ACS meetings and various types of events out here so good job thanks for taking our advice and you're already taking a big step by you know going to these events and lectures and stuff like that so thank you everyone for looking up to us and listening to us and hope you great success in your marine science futures yeah run in T as as as we've been going along

hello everyone and welcome back to the well Nerds podcast my name is Slater I'm here with Kaelyn and Eric hello hey everyone this is episode number 15 and we have a guest today yes yes her name is Kate Cummings she is the owner and captain of blueish and whale watch what's up guys thanks for coming yeah we're excited to have you yeah this is cool and Kate went on a super awesome trip within the last month or so to Antarctica and we have her here to tell us all about it what when did you guys leave that was the middle of February so they're pretty much for the whole second half how long were you gone for it was Wow right it was over two weeks Wow yeah I feel like we were all like oh we gotta get someone from another code we gotta get someone from Antartica like we kept talking about it in previous episodes so finally we got someone I feel like you're the only person I really knew that was on the boat really well I mean I know Ted and I'm sure we'll have him on here for like happy whale or something eventually yeah that's exciting what was what you guys see was it cold you know it really wasn't that cold it kind of it ranged from like 28 degrees to 34 and we got extremely lucky with the weather too we barely had any rough weather like hardly any wind most days were sunny um yeah 28 to 32 do you feel like it wasn't cold because you're dressed for the cold yes because when you go to cold places like like say we go to Lake Tahoe right you're like dress for and then I go it's not that cold here but it's like it is colder than like you know Monterey yeah and I mean if you're used to California too I mean it it definitely felt cold yeah but you know he just and just Slayer up getting there is quite an adventure to write it's not just a straight flight there yeah getting there definitely sucks oh cool that the travel to it is worth it but but yeah I think we it was over 30 hours total being in a plane for cheese yeah you flew down to Argentina are you swaiiow yeah I mean then there was there were stops in between well first we stopped in we went to Punta Arenas actually so in Chile and then yeah so there was the first time they actually did that where we flew from Punta Arenas to King George Island which is the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula that was the first time he did that so we skipped one of the Drake Passage crossings and then so the ship was waiting for us there in Antarctica and then the passengers that were on the ship got off and so we basically walked past them and they got on the plane that we yeah that's crazy but yeah even that that first flight was insane because we were in the plane ready to go and then we had to deplane because there was so much wind where the ship was in King George Island that those passengers couldn't get off oh okay there's no dock or anything oh yeah so the captain didn't let any of the passengers getting zodiacs we had to wait for the wind to die down so we all hang out in the airport for like five hours how many people were in total we're on the boat there were a hundred passengers and I think it was like 40 crew but I mean crew that included like you know the people that were running the ship okay and then it was like this Canadian company that leased the ship and only a few of them were left and then it was Cheeseman's ecology if art safaris that we went with and so they basically like piggybacked on this Canadian company okay so how many people were at the cheese means you know um I would guess maybe like 15 to 20 yourself hmm something like that do you know a lot of people about I did yeah because I recruited a lot of passengers that I know from pollution we'll watch and then got to meet some whale watchers from Washington like Aaron John's glass Medford yeah cool to meet her yeah there's a lot of whale watchers on it and how are the accommodations you literally slept on the boat for that pretty much the entire two weeks right yeah they were good uh I mean you didn't really need to spend that much time in your room that's good the ship that we were on it wasn't catered for like a luxury cruise or nothing it was basically set up like like everyone was in a crew cabin okay so just like a bunk in a small closet basically yeah and a sink yeah we basically felt like you were living in a closet nice scenery outside yeah and we had a good window cuz we had a porthole that was maybe like two feet open it was there what was the first thing you guys did uh the first thing it was it was like action-packed from the beginning Ted Cheeseman who was running the trip I mean he really had an awesome itinerary set up so we would basically wake up like at 6:30 it had like a half hour for breakfast and then it's go back to your rooms get your gear on and get in the zodiacs come on you would either just zip around in zodiacs looking at things like looking at icebergs and scenery and looking for whales and seals and stuff or you would do a landing and almost every single landing we did there were penguins oh cool Wow yeah how many different types of penguins did you see there we saw three so we saw the Adelie penguins the chin straps and then it was mostly a Gentoo penguins that we saw nice day how many of you guys how many of those have you guys seen none none in the wild unfortunately I think they're funny lucky how are you funny they just have you wouldn't think that well I mean birds are smart but they just had personalities and and they don't have any reason to fear humans longing they did when explorers first came to anyway they walk right in front of you how tall was the tallest penguin oh you saw um they were probably what would that be like really that's big that's awesome yeah and we actually did see some chicks so we were kind of there late in the season um and so most of the chicks you would have to like look hard for the little fuzzy fits that were salon down feathers um but then there were some that had some really late in the season I think they were saying it was like a really small chance that they would survive but we did see really tiny new chicks that's awesome yeah any other birds flying around yeah there were a lot of giant petrels that we saw on land mmm I can't remember she looks like a little chicken it would always look for a mother penguin feeding its chick and so which is dumping regurgitated krill into its mouth and sometimes the the parent would miss and it would follow the side whatever reason they didn't want to eat what was on the ground so these she feels come in and eat that know sometimes even like knockout chicks is there any albatross yeah we did see some albatross like black-browed albatross and we were at Drake Passage but because it was so calm and not so breezy there weren't a whole time is it wandering albatross go there bad ones are really cool there's striking features yeah look guys I just googled she's built it does look like a chicken she's right did you see any seals hauling out on like random floating icebergs yes that could mean you see pictures of it but you just didn't expect really to see him just in the middle of nowhere just to fall asleep get off at that's cool what seals did you see we saw crabeater seals we saw the most of there were the Weddell seals and then the scary leopard seals scary leopard seals they look scary they do they their faces they're they're intense look like yeah that's crabeater seals have really cool teeth oh yeah did you talk about that before how they're like in turn yeah yeah yeah definitely Google that if you guys are at home Google crabeater seals teeth because they're pretty cool looking how baby those leopard seals emit what's the biggest one you saw pretty intimidating [Music] sealions eyes hmm definitely not like an adult stellar sea lion bigger than you attacked people there was there was one night had dinner with the ship's doctor who's all like communal like dinners and yeah please pick a table and then people would sit down and stuff and you talk to them there's one time we were with the doctor and I kind of regretted asking him but I was like what's the worst injury he'll attack yeah actually robbing people's arms odx I would never everyone in the water I was just saying [Laughter] Paul Nicklin just gets in the water so I know that's crazy what any dolphins they're dolphins no Nautica we didn't see dolphins in Antarctica but we didn't see um I think you pronounced it peels dolphins when we were in we're gonna look at our reference chart here and that is the leuco quarter poster that we all love in the door you taught to eat Saul I'm in the street we saw them message there were some also near the the beagle channel which was mmm we started in Argentina back almost like a lab yeah there's all that great huh and then what other cetaceans did you see we saw a lot of humpback whales and then we saw two different types of killer whales lots of minke whales and then we got super lucky in the Drake Passage on the way back a few of us saw some Southern bottlenose whales yeah a very brief glue because you can't like stop yeah what can all these random things yeah there is probably like six or eight of them and they surface I mean the like 300 someone feed yeah and then there's just this pot of wheels that pops up like less than a hot like as close as you would get if you were on a whale-watching yeah crazy little rostrum they have that's things yeah and you can see it I mean I didn't have gift boaters oh no dang yeah we're gonna have to send us a photo for the thumbnail the spot guys know you we can hear that scream that's crazy and there's like ice in the background so if you guys don't know what we're talking about while they were still in Antarctica or maybe coming home this photo popped up on Facebook and it was Kate and her friend Haley well our friend Haley and who else is in the boat with you this Australian woman named Meryl who's one of the guide yeah and they had this humpbacks bye happy next to the boat and hates faces like her mouth open wide - so happy and Haley also just looks like oh my god I hopped over and over again I mean so close I mean you could reach out and touch it if you wanted to one kept spyhopping and the other one just had its head underneath the stern funny that I was hanging out by the back of boat in Baja the gray wolves were always at the stern of the boat like inches all the ones we saw their head was at the edge of like the right where the you know props are like just sitting there obviously they're off but yeah or the or warm water the warm water it works out yeah I don't know if the humpbacks are doing the same thing but that's awesome so you saw humpbacks minke whales and then two types of killer whales what killer was did you see so we saw type a and they look a lot like our transient killer whales here like same size about the same size eyepatch and to be kind of hard to tell them apart but they have a very diet I think and there sometimes eating minke whales oh wow and they definitely hunted something it was really early in the morning it was actually kind of cool because it I was I got sick a lot of people got sick on the from the plane ride there was a cold go around someone like seasickness oh yeah now you're going to get sick or you don't get sick actually said yeah yeah anyways so we're like our worst nightmare I was like people that loved whales we just randomly like start getting seasick but I was up really early cuz I didn't feel good and so I went and I got a coffee and I came back to the room and I was looking out the window and I saw a dorsal fin and it had just gotten just gotten light and so everyone else on this ship is is asleep and whatever it was like a half hour before breakfast you know and announcement would come in to remember one had like a PA in there and so you hear Ted's voice but once I sighed like threw down my coffee cup and I put on my big jacket and I ran up to to the bridge where there was one captain in there and the side door was open and I was like there's killer whales over there and he goes maybe I'm not really sure and it was like no and you can't be that person's like no listen you can do it I can trust me some random person that's offered and like a blue whale or like your wake yeah except for the other day there was topics we had fastened risk and it was like literally flatter than a lake out there so it was pretty bad like literally swimming in your wake right now we're like no they're not it's just our way so two types of killer whales the first one was the one at the a it look like yeah oh it was really cool about those was that so we think they had killed something there was a bunch of birds really tiny petrels - but humpbacks came in like they do here when killer whales have attacked like a seal or a great whale no way and they were acting actually like the saviors of the seat no and the second type was what yeah the type little bees I guess there's two different types of type bees the ones we saw are usually seen in then the Garrosh Strait where we were and there's like 20 or 25 of them and what's their diet oh cool I think they eat but the other type B are the ones that spy hop near like ice floes and watch the seals yeah I'm so cool so you have to go again then yes see now we all have to go yeah I thought it'd be like a one-time thing but maybe next year's our year I think about it we just went to be 20 years save up I know it's like buying a small car I bought a car cheaper than [Music] well we went to Baja we did that this year so now maybe next year is our time to go to NRT I could sell my camera and then go but it wouldn't happen borrow someone else's icebergs you can use my GoPro yeah hopefully all those penguins will be there when I get there I don't know will they what they say oh they came they like strong are they endangered um I honestly don't know what they're I think they were worried about certain types like taking over the territory like I think they're worried about a delis there was an issue where there's some penguins that actually are taking advantage of their being less ice and then there's some who actually can take advantage of there being more ice so it kind of goes back and forth yeah I remember seeing a documentary or something yeah I'm having to walk really far yeah to get food and it's a cause in and some of them are making it back and like it's a big ordeal I just discovered a colony of Adelie so they didn't know existed like last year - oh really I think you saw penguins at the Aquarium of the Pacific yeah we had magellanic so it's a completely different stuff I saw African penguins and Maui yeah there's penguins along with just like cruising around in there they have like a little igloo that's like not an igloo but they go in it's kind of cool but you're talking about those penguins out there in such large colonies they heard that supposedly even from Google Earth if you go on the satellite view you can see patches of it's not necessarily penguins but where the Penguins were you can see that that brown patches they left from all their droppings and stuff like that so some of these colonies are pretty big yeah so did they make it seem like there was a lot more other stuff you could see did you see at all no because I they have night inner Airy in mind and sometimes it's like the weather that'll stop him from doing it but for us it was almost always ice that was stopping us like for instance there was this one channel the lemaire channel that we wanted to get through one of the times we in it we went through it twice before but we wanted to go through it again but so much ice had clogged up the channel that we had to go all the way around it and so the new tack on time doing that and yeah there were some areas we wanted to get to and they were just like scenic areas yeah wasn't like for animals anything and I think they had like an idea that there were gonna be a lot of whales in a certain area and we couldn't get their back we have no idea mhm yeah I think I remember Ted talking to me on the phone about there being like an area where there's tons of hot packs yeah and the humpbacks there are that's their feeding Road you see any type of feeding activity at all um we did I saw the only feeding I saw oh did I take it back there there what's weird as they do bubble net feeding there Oh which really surprised me because I thought they only did it for fish I didn't think I was even worth it for curling it for krill but they actually do bubble net feeding for krill and they don't come out super vertical when I'm feeding it's all on their side like when we see him doing it for krill acuter very interesting that I saw that from a distance and then some other people saw it close-up from their zodiacs mhm we've been getting more side lunging the last couple weeks than we have been getting the vertical lunging here have been so big they're just like cruising through it like I have a video from the drone and the thing the humpback literally opened his mouth like so slow-motion he's just like yeah we thought I saw yeah a few days ago then that we see like anchovies eating girl and then I swear it looked like there was red and anchovy falling I'll tell ya I've seen that before Hollywood because they sidelines you the whole time I was like this is very mas you guys haven't seen any krill really in front of us no yeah so you never know yeah okay so you're friendly whales I want to go back to that what happened who you guys were just out and I just like started bugging you or what well so we had so in this picture it's just you know me and my friend hailey and then the driver when usually those zodiacs would have usually at least ten passengers yeah yeah um and so we had been already on the water for a couple of hours away in this spot and it was so gorgeous that day I mean it was it was sunny it was glassy flat and so we've been watching wheels a little bit before and a lot of the passengers in her boat were ready to go and wanted to go back to the ship but there was still a lot of time that we had left before we and so the driver took them back they all got off except for me and Haley we had just a little bit of time after that and then we went straight to where where Ted Cheeseman was was watching whales he was driving this other zodiac and as we were approaching that whale was going towards their boat and you could see its spine like yeah slithering like a snake and I was going up to their boat and it did a few passes and then turned and came straight for us and did a bunch of spy hops and the other boat and then another boat came in and it checked them out and did you see the whales eyeball yes under the water and above the water when it's by hopped it didn't come far enough out that if I was above the water but there was one time where one was coming you know horizontal next to the boat and it twisted and as it twisted the water fell off I was now you might have made a connection with that way and didn't recognize a lot of the whales that you guys saw over there um I think he was able to match a handful of them oh cool yeah I think he posted like on here guys is like first or second date and he may do so much yeah about seeing some okay yeah definitely and those all go do all of them go there no they go there's several different places where they come from and I think that's why it's so hard to get matches oh cool their breeding grounds yeah some do good I'll show you though right so that man they just go like oh we really are excited off the coast of Africa though too right for you yeah some long trips there and they all had like white on them huh so yeah I mean if even if you're just seeing them arch their backs and they don't their flutes and you can see the white stretching up that's awesome white there was covering their bellies and I don't know if we've talked about this before on the podcast but humpback whales around the world have different they're all counter shaded so they're darker on the top and lighter on the underside but the whales that we see in central California are really dark like even the underside of their PEC flippers sometimes it's all black and then their flukes will be all black whereas in the southern hemisphere a lot of the whales are very light on the underside like the top and bottom of their PEC fins will be white all the way up to their chin will be white their flukes can be all white so it's definitely they look different than in the world you see in California and we had that one show up last summer and you were a little cat a little one I was jumping down everywhere yeah I had all white yeah yeah it was breathing it free Shaq every day yeah I honestly feel like it breached every day yeah so and that one is really white we were all like oh my god yeah that's well do you put any of your yeah that's cool yeah I have some from Iceland and I'm like really pumped on that like two IDs right they're not even matched but they're just on there so one day someone does I think they go to like the Caribbean yes and we're done that way so out of all the trips you've done kata I you know I know you've done a lot I've even been with you for a few of your whale adventures would you say this was the best trip ever for a wildlife or um it was way up there yes absolutely I would say it was I think the scenery beats bah ha ha ha but the experience with whales I think in Baja is unbeatable yeah that's true but it was just a feast for the eyes the backgrounds were pretty like if you put some ice in the background then it's like that's all you want snow I got excited some height though and a girl in like California Franklin won't even here for some of us like me it's later like there sometimes we would go so far up the coast you end up at Port of Long Beach and you got cranes and stuff in the background you know where's here you know you pray that the whales gonna PV or Laguna where you get some greenery it's all pretty yeah icebergs they're like sculptures Oh didn't Tim say something about icebergs being like are you you said like eight miles long or something yeah and it's literally detached right really they're like real blocky and flat it looks like land from from far away but it's moving there they could live on that and it's Haley put them in E city like what yeah Haley put up some picture of like supposedly that blue ice or something but something about fresh water being in it yeah and I'm probably bad at describing it yeah so it's like squeezes all the oxygen out of it something like that yeah okay I thought you guys are not gonna hold it come up to it and drink it or something if there was a piece of ice that was so compressed you know that it looks like an ice sculpture people were bringing that back yeah they look like glass that's cool so now were you guys did you see any other tour groups there it was a basically people from your ship that's what was really neat was that you it didn't feel like there was a lot of other yeah activity and I think they managed it really well down there and they must keep in contact with each other because they're they're really strict about landings you can only have a hundred people oh there's a hundred passengers out on a landing time it's not what was so cool about cheese's that there was only a hundred of us so we didn't have to like hang back on the ship and rotate and there's only a few other times where we saw other ships that's awesome yeah yeah that's cool to be in a remote place and not see any other humans sides the ones that are with you obviously yeah I think the time to go is like now because it sounds like it's gonna get crazier down there a little later in there well but also like but within the next few years you mean because yeah yeah yeah people jumping on creating more and there's bigger ships going yeah yeah all the National Geographic ships and stuff like that now when you go and those land-based excursions like what the Penguins in house they just wandering or their guides or their like trails to get to the animals so our guides are really good they would go to the landing first and kind of scope it out oh cool um cuz if there were fur seals they didn't want us to be there I don't think they're mean they're just they don't want to be bothered it makes him something harass him anyways but I'm wondering what they like charge you there yeah there was one landing actually it wasn't just ice that stopped it from doing things if they were a bunch of fur seals on the beach then we couldn't really interesting so you thought first it was - yeah oh cool yeah they make real weird sounds like that would del feel underwater is where the Weddell seals make the crazy sounds sound like so yeah can't they do it above water - no the video online maybe they just put me you know why the Cheetahs cuz that one that's like viral on Instagram is like it's one that's laying on a pea size it's like underwater really yeah minke whales make like for sound in the comments my friends so the guys would go to the beaches and then they would they would take poles with them and they would kind of stake them in areas where we were allowed to walk really yeah so you could basically follow a trail huh maybe kind of funny to you because you'd have to keep watch where that where the poles were because you would think you're going on a path like a path but it's not penguin path like like a little like divot yeah and yeah you think it's like a human and then they would block off areas like if it was like a steep drop and you guys actually saw like chip chicks right like little itty bitty guys yeah yeah the late-season chicks happy so well this year like out of the whole trip what was the most memorable part I mean definitely the friendly yeah the friendly no friendly humpbacks but just I mean looking back on it and and you know thinking about the icebergs and I mean it's just so wild that you can get into zodiac and move around all the ice I mean there are times where you're just you're bumping into it yeah that's going around the boat and and there was one one day we woke up and I had formed where it wasn't the day before they called a while pancake uh-huh and so you just see it forming on the surface oh wow and now is really trippy well that's neat yeah what about the minke whales they were they were more interesting down there really up here there minke whales in Monterey have like say like little white spots on their back they're a little different than ours right well ours have one band of white on the flipper yeah and I think I don't know if it's on both sides of the Antarctic ones or not or just the one so our common yeah Oh the ones are bigger yeah wow they're much bigger oh they don't have the band on didn't dad dwarf minke he's they're not that we thought okay but um but they were kind of friendly like they they'd cruise over to the boat that's cool were they in like numbers um we would see like it's like the same here where if there were if they were in a group it would be like two or three oh cool mm-hmm that's cool someone got an amazing picture they had a wide-angle lens on and a minke came straight towards the center of the boat and then turned at the last minute and so you can see its whole head its eye and it was kind of tilted so you can see it's white belly and oh and the water is pretty much crystal-clear there right it was surprisingly clear it's funny because it's time to like krill and nutrients in it obviously that's why everything does that the whales are covered in diatoms yeah obviously floating out in the ocean why do they get those diatoms they're you know I should have gone to more lectures I was so perfect about getting a sit again that I didn't want to go to any of the lecture but because it's you know salt water and then melting ice and something with the fresh water meaning the salt water I think is good for the diatoms and said they've just got a bunch of diatoms on him and they show so much more on these humpbacks on the way how much white one if they lose them once they go back that they do so the reason why it sticks the skin so well too is because they don't really move a lot of blood at the surface of their skin when they're in Antarctica cuz it's super cold and so like there's just a lot of dead skin and the diatoms build up on their skin and then when they go to the warmer water they can circulate blood to their skin a lot easier and not lose as much body heat so then they'll just slough off slough off slough off so much skin just comes off as they're migrating north that's why I have a little fish by them yeah but that's also like Bob Pitman with like the killer whales he's he has a theory that they'll make these like four-day runs like subtropic waters just to slough off that stuff off their skin and then come back just to do a skin maintenance trip and I think killer whales do that yeah yeah that's what you say yeah they heat that's his theory with killer whales at either Pole is that they do these skin maintenance quick migrations and then come back he's surprised yeah seems like our cetaceans have to really have a skin care regimen at times well yeah I mean like the turtles and killer whales been seen the robot rocks Howell beaches that guys talked about you know different proximate you know that live stream in Washington have you guys ever watch it yeah yes I had to break it - not exactly live at it's like when they know they're there but then it then it always says like what does it say on the side now or I can read letters it says something like pre-recorded or used to just say live and we would watch it in the shop last year I watched it's [Music] basically it's all their prime times that they've gone by but it's cool like an octopus walks by out of nowhere yeah and then you know they go back by then a harbor seal goes off it's like too perfect I think water there yeah cuz they go you know how they are there I think sometimes you can see the whales like breathing at the surface from the cameras it's just not actually live all right so Antarctica you were there Pro tips any pro tips no private plane we're no surgical masks on board yeah definitely do that no that was that was probably the hardest part was because I had probably a fever for the first three days I don't want to miss anything and so I forced myself to go out on the zodiacs then you get worse and I was so bad because staying on the zodiac for like four hours on this overcast day looking at icebergs and then I I got colder than I've ever been you know when it's like in your bones and you can't get rid of ya but ya bring a lot of layers socks bring I like to double up or just as a kid I was running three pairs of socks so like a my feet were first - yeah and I was surprised like I didn't bring I thought people were being crazy for bringing like toe warmers and hand warmers I'm like I'm not gonna pack that that's stupid [Laughter] I'm cold and I complain about it every day on the bow that my hands are cold but like I can't have that and shoot photos what am I gonna do like the glue hand warmers outside of my hand I don't like using gloves cuz I feel like I can't control the settings as well and yeah you can cut the fingertips but like I just got used to it I got one that you can you know touch like screens within stuff and it's just kind of felt like wetsuit material okay so they weren't like that they're like cloth II kinda done I mean right no it wasn't like that the kind I get wet and they like freeze they were really good I like my gloves cuz I had him on pretty much all all the time and here's a random question that people often asked about especially being on a boat how was food what is impressive its if they really know how I mean it's two weeks uh-huh and I thought we wouldn't have any fresh vegetables by by the end uh-huh but they did a really good job so you'd have like you know really green leafy things for salad in the beginning and then towards the end it's like cabbage and shredded carrots and stuff okay they were really good and it's a lot of food I'm not good with the face I'm good at so much you're good at catering soon I mean I don't have any dietary restrictions I'll eat whatever uh-huh there were a lot of people that had specific things yeah they were they were awesome that's good dessert after dinner they're like a pre breakfast breakfast yeah actually yeah there wasn't Baja to they like put cereal and bread and all things and I'm like fooling all right now what do you got a lot of Records I was like what I'd like yogurt and a peanut butter sandwich I had like so much food and then they did a real breakfast I was like dang it ted's boys come over to PA announcing that to its pre breakfast breakfast no no he would yes was there like a meeting spot for like an itinerary every day or um they would announce like when he woke us up over the intercom he would kind of say what what the plan was and then at breakfast um if there was something he needed to tell us then he would announce it when everyone's having breakfast that's cool and then at dinner he would say like what the plan is for the next day did they do any speeches on the boat lots of lectures oh yeah but again I never went cuz I was terrified of being in a room with 100 people Wow so you learned getting nothing but I've been in the lectures and that cool tell me about a month yeah well you would think that the weather would be bad and that would make you want to go to lectures but we never had bad weather and so we wanted to be outside the whole time looking and you could like walk around outside yeah ship right and I'm pretty sure when those southern bottlenose whales happen I think there was a lecturer going on Oh everybody walked out of the lecture the lady's like whoa I didn't finish telling you the but yeah I feel like I gotta go yeah just some rare stuff happening outside of forget what you're saying I heard of that like I mean I feel like we've talked about this before but that's a crazy well to see yeah that's not on our list you know that's crazy it's on our list now yeah yes I feel like one in a lot of trips yeah the woman actually the woman who was on the zodiac with us with with the friendly humpbacks studies beaked whales oh really yeah and she our survey the same as the rest a squid I'm not actually I've never seen him I've never read about them what if they stay down longer than like they never know which one of them there's one of those in fact we only know of because because they've been found is this gonna be like one of those dinosaur things I could tax you just a baby one you never know Pacific it's actually they used to think they were Barrett's but then they decided they were their own species really yeah interesting basically there was like 12 dinosaurs right and but there was like small ones and they were actually just baby true without it was big renaming them all to like they were giving them all these names cuz they want to declare that they found you know a new species yeah but they were really just like juvenile so they whittled it down to like only there's only seven yeah basically scientists like the name things that's why it caused the problem yeah yeah that's a good TED talk who found that you Horner and he's like yeah he's like the guy who Jurassic Park what's his name I don't need a buddy the main kind Reggie Parker's based on him dinosaur museum in British Columbia so he was like yeah we're allowed to test the boat densities cuz they're my skeleton bison up yetiz great Fossum yeah so you came back and you've been whale watching every day since pretty mom yeah I guess kind of oh when you came back we were having weather still long yeah yeah the first day back it was still rough out there hey Caitlin guess what Kate saw the other day Southern residents is so here you also have all seen leatherback sea turtles so go away I did we did a turtle trip any super game to do that again okay we do a turtle trip yeah like walks around and talks to you I think we should make an all day where yeah some time is dedicated to you guys okay turtles are showing up again I'm calling you yeah and so that's what I told sky was like if we get you know a couple sightings then I'm gonna plan one on a morning that looks like it would be because you really wanted to have to be glad you can see them better yeah it was a super overcast flat calm day no turtles up here yeah last summer was good it was a leatherback yeah that's how I was surprised we saw someone I went from seeing none to like two a days remember that one that swam under the boat you haven't gone a week so when you go back to like four or five days a week you'll definitely see one I hope so that we saw it they did come for a couple days in a row cuz the years when I was on the ocean like every day we had no leather backs I think there was like one turtle sighting in the two years that I was on the ocean like every day possible that El Nino those yeah yeah it was like 15 and 16 yeah we did jellies no because of the warm water or what there's like cross jellies but those are not yeah yeah the I mean in the last two years that we've had there's been I got to pedigree well okay there you go I kissed one okay well so what's that we have killer roses in yeah probably I have bad dog this year there were some around yesterday she stopped for these like boring northern right whale about yeah we had a good show of dolphins I took a good nap on the boat house well do you guys are in Monterey Bay we didn't go the killer whales but we saw these other super rare dolphins yeah it was like a day for black and white if I was really really gonna be pumped to see the killer was because then we would have saw killer whales Pacific white-sided almonds and Northern Iowa Velvets and they're all locked but they were 33 yeah well they were seven towards the end but they were continuing so by the time we got there they would have been like another seven another said we would head David's team out or something just kicking around I think it was just Emma's yeah but I think because there's one sprouter in there that looks like why was liner with them yes six six with Minard seven because he's always tagging along but he's not technically part of their Oh Eric doesn't have a catalog yeah in case you guys forgot what day Eric posted that on that was April Fool's Day yeah April Fool's yeah this is your insider information but those pictures look really well organized like someone does have a catalog put one together everything's it'll take four years to put one together you said it took four hours exact my hard drive is killer whale killer well photos I wish I was that organized catalog on your shirt right now this might be accurate there that my old gray whenever he still has granny up here she make a Vicki dough it's just sorry for my dark humor everyone okay how long have you been well watching are like working in 11 years now where did you start at I started that sanctuary creases oh did you like wells before that yes like absolutely obsessed with whales had dreams about whales all the time I didn't I was like you know oh yeah I always yeah my wife wakes up and she's like how's your like how do you sleep wherever I was like I turned about like killer whales or something like that and she's like had a bad dream and I was like why are you doing that way my wheels are always in a sea lion that was like I was swimming with orcas and - sea lions like you're not going back over there it's like talks to you like a man sea lion being your like identity well the seal I was just talking like a human that's all I mean it was like you're not gonna get back over those killer whales I was like I have to and I had to drone up all they following them I knew where they were so after sanctuary how do you well I know this or I'm asking anyway how did you end up with your own boat I don't want that it was she won the lottery bottom done well I was working with sanctuary the owners that had it at the time not now wanted to sell it and get rid of it and I was considering doing that along with Jim who started working at sanctuary or start working on sanctuary when I was there and then we decided we didn't want to do that but we met each other while working on sanctuary and decided hey let's just get a different boat and start a new company and it's awesome cool yeah how long you been owning blue ocean since 2011 sweet that's not a years now I know that's cool do not feel like it's been that long what a rough life you just go well watching every day know things like yesterday happen you know there's Coast Guard there's things involved with every job government agency asset but it's all paperwork now what's some of my better memories like watching had been on here but what's your best memory on that the high spirits let me guess the for breaching humpbacks I was thinking about that just the other day how many years ago was that that was 2015 yeah I think he doesn't my first time my parent in 2014 I had like heard about this place that had all these whales like the first day there was like 15 humpbacks lunch feeding and preaching everywhere and then they wanted to leave these humpbacks go to common dolphins I hate these people you've been working in some yes yes 13 yeah so that's why he was like common dolphins what the hell I was at my Instagram today like 2014 below it's like just common common common common common common like dude how many like common up and going left covered and going right yeah you got a lot of free will the humpback seemed to love the high spirits - it's not a friendly web friendly encounter up - you just had a video that went like a lot of people shared it though there are recently rare couple my one of your friendlies last year does it expire I think it was her name she went to Antarctica to Haley yeah really yeah yeah she I think she took the video or someone to the video three yeah oh actually and then um the BBC guy Tom Tom Tom use some of that footage to in his documentary yeah we had two that were spyhopping next high spirits together so what was your favorite time encounter uh it's there's been so many things and it's funny to like what I enjoy has like evolved over time to you I mean in the beginning I was super obsessed with killer whales I still killer whales but over time you just fall in love so much with with humpback whales to me they're the most interesting and charismatic to watch but and then also to becoming a captain what you enjoy is different as well because I got the camera down a lot and and for me probably like a good joy something really simple when you've just pasted a whale perfectly all right it's gonna be down like eight minutes then it pops out right next to you or yeah we just anticipate something that's correct and I'm wrong so many times when you're right it feels so good when you decide to leave something and go looking at where else and then find something so I think like every all-day trip not everyone but most of the ones I've been on on your boat we're like on our way and we find killer whales or something yeah that always happened all DJs I mean it's just so cool if you have so much time to spend out there and cannot just look at all you know the hot spots in the bay but then also outside I mean it's just so so amazing the variety that you can come across yeah I guess you're we're in the middle of nowhere and then that sea lion pops up ya have a sand dab yeah and threw it around I was in the bathroom taking pictures out the window like 15 miles or Moslem oh speaking of that I'm in the bathroom and we're looking at aback say Aldo and I was like prepared for them to come back up and then one breach is like just like three feet out of the view of the bathroom so you know I hear everybody going like run up and there's like a big splash the people who don't know is you guys think about stink you're crazy right now I think you're sitting in the bathroom tell them why now they think you're extra crazy that you're sitting in the city so on the high spirits the bathroom and even your like lifejacket room they both the window is like pretty much like three feet off the water and so you're really low and it's like absolutely most amazing shots you can get from there because of their perspective so people it's a thing people go to use the restroom on that boat because I always want to go down there's a bang on the door text and you really need to go man daddy's going a life jacket room make it less vanilla shot from there oh my god like that that trip we were coming in on that we followed a unentangled humpback out for like yeah and then you know we came back in and then next thing you know that was karma feeding and yeah good great lighting clothes lunges that whale was like entangled but it was weird like look like it was just a piece of rope hanging from like the pack I don't yeah I think they thought it was just like snagged on a vertical yeah it was gonna come off cuz the job I mean I couldn't see it anywhere else from the drone yeah yeah anyway so yeah we followed this wheel that was entangled and then the response team wasn't gonna come out and we had spent so much time I call it babysitting the whale and you're waiting for the response team to come out and we had passengers on it was an all-day trip and after we left the whales we're heading back in it was just about sunset and then we came across like 20 lunge feeding humpback whales it was like one two like that's how quickly their lunch meeting I think back to back to back everything was perfect you know how you're on one side the whales for a while and then it goes to sunset then you switch to the other side and like they just gave us the most time in the world to shoot them all right well Antarctica seemed absolutely amazing and I definitely feel like I want to go there you do yeah she'd do it so hopefully we can save up money one day and go there sell a house or something and go there kidney body parts well thank you so much for coming thanks for having me thanks for sharing your Antartica story with us or super stoked and how you got started into well watching yeah and if you want to go out with Kate her company's called bluish and whale watch it's in Moss Landing and you definitely booked through her website gawk at all her fun social media things don't message your own Instagram because she doesn't even know how to give her message I think she's just figuring it out yesterday yeah well thank you so much for coming thank you guys for listening to this podcast if you don't follow us on social media we have an Instagram it's well nerds and yeah thanks so much for listening yeah thank you thanks everyone

hello everyone and welcome back to the well nerd podcast this is episode number 16 my name is Slater and I'm here with Eric and Caitlyn hey guys hello and we have so much to talk about we do I don't know but did you guys did you guys hear about all those basking sharks in island I asked for them to be sent to Monterey please okay question didn't they used to see basking sharks in Monterey like a lot equally yeah so maybe they're gonna come this summer I know there is that was it maybe three four years ago there's a good batch of them off a Big Sur I think a few boats cartoon hey wait if I go down soon fire on Thursday my day off will they still be there when I get there hopefully yeah every time today and I said hey I'm coming tomorrow Isaac's week all I want too let's call out tomorrow okay hopefully okay another thing I want to be mad about last day not the last day one cuz I want yesterday but last what day do we see the fifty ones so like seven days ago days ago the best trip ever to fit the CA fifty ones eating a sea lion playing and doing all sorts of cool stuff and then we get off the water that day and then it just blows 30 knots and above for like five or six days straight and now this beautiful blue water that we have is green or it's like brown that's really what you were upset about is the visibility of the water yeah all sorts of stuff out there hey but you know what it's not a bad thing either yeah good thing we'll have more whales to photographs yeah nutrients but less like NatGeo colors oh my god okay I've been watching a lot of our planet and like okay so Slater also gave us the caveat before we started recording that he's officially spoiled if you didn't figure that actually okay someone on that came on the boat or two people came on the boat yesterday and they they said oh we're surprised to see you here when the weather's like [Laughter] I'm so mad these killer whales are in brown-water first world probably need to see the echolocate yeah but do you still want to see the anchovies there's a lot lot of anchovies out there these last few days it just means seeing nothing but big huge patches like that whole theory called when two whales like it actually works yep exactly whatever it really works here Monterey there was tons of whales and tons of brown stuff in the water all those primary producers but that's creating oxygen right what that mean yeah actually that surface turbulence yeah helps oxygen exchange there yes and then you know the more primary producers you have the more co2 that's being pulled out of the atmosphere for their photosynthesis and then I think you better briefly Caitlin explained upwelling to people like what they document yeah I don't think actually I don't think we've talked we got it about the canyon and why we have that boy yeah actually not in detail no for really so upwelling um is a basically the overview of it is it's a persistent wind pattern that between the constant direction of the wind and the turn of the earth ends up pulling the water away from shore and then the cold water from depths comes up to replace the water that's moving off the top of the surface but here in Monterey the canyon kind of super tried charges the effect because there's deep water near shore and so there's just even more nutrients and cold water stored right near land so you have the input of fresh water and the nutrients from land and then you have the canyon right there and then you have this persistent northwest wind pattern that we get very heavily in central California and so those three factors combined just like makes the it fertilizes the ocean at a rate way higher than all other areas around it so basically the wind blows the water inshore and then the other water comes out yeah the wind blows the water towards the shore but the earth is spinning so it ends up actually pulling it away from the show that's spinning affect the other call it the Coriolis effect or and then the water comes up from the canyon the cold water at the top yeah the nutrient-rich cold water right net force is like an overturn of those how come it seems so much cleared there's it because it's been turned up cuz like when you see videos you know like from in barrio marine snow down there but the also the the speed of the current is a lot slower so there's not as much turbulence so things are settling out and sometimes they got such brilliant lighting on those RVs it makes it look a little clearer sometimes there's not that's why I also feel like you know like you as a photographer you don't post all your stuff if it's not the best clarity or the best whatever and so I think they don't post on every but its employees they probably have plenty of images where it's like totally snowed out and they can't see anything and then they just don't post them yeah so wind is good wind is in a way wind me and it makes the whales jump it's actually just a fact straight fact it really is yeah last paper out there there is a general consensus among scientists that true breaching yesterday it's like you see it was end of this well or into the waves should we should we touch really quickly on that actual breaching paper I don't think I have a copy but we can probably top it's also like I think we talked about how they think you might be like communication and we talked about yeah and before that it was the exercise theory I think yeah wish I kept a copy here small that's all right we talked about silver arrow that we saw her talk about that legend yeah I mean that was cool to see everybody like clapping stuff when she came in yeah she she's something else man she's in her I guess we missed it like she did a bigger speech during the day yeah so we just she just kind of introduced that her movie emission blue which is on Netflix yeah really cool you should definitely check it out if you haven't seen it yeah I don't know we out we have never seen it you haven't seen me I know I've seen it I didn't realize that I've seen it I had to watch it again when you mentioned in it and then ice lock there's like I've seen this so they actually came out 2014 it's really good hadn't seen it yeah cuz I love that kind of stuff it really ended up being more about like Sylvia's journey as a woman scientists because she really was a pioneer in the field for women in science especially marine science yeah I loved it one of the first people to go deep - mm-hmm yeah I was really cool it's funny cuz I went to click it on my Netflix when I got home to show Margo and it was already halfway through someone watched it sleep or something yeah I loved it because it's a little bit about her and then also about you know what she's doing and kind of it's one of those make you wake up and open your eyes type of a deal see her visiting those those reefs that she once went to before and you know the end where she goes bad I couldn't believe that she I mean she was she was very stoic about it but like I was I have just I said this later I was like how many times do you think she's had to go to a place like that and see it destroyed because I would have just been devastated yeah if I would have had that experience but I think that's also probably not even the first half dozen time she's had to do that they just opened another hope spot in Australia they did yeah but yeah I think they just opened up just like literally like two days ago oh wow yeah so if you don't know what I hope spot is that's part of severe Earl's mission is to create these conservation areas in the oceans at an unprecedented rate so like trying to really cover a significant portion of the globe with these hope spots because most countries have have some level of oceanic protection whether it's a reserve or a conservation area or sanctuary but it's still like less than 10% of the globe is protected less than 10% of the oceans so what she's trying to do is get what do they want like 33% or something like it was like 20% Yahoo something 20 20 22 percent something like that towards the end of the documentary they actually put out some numbers of what their goal is but it's really scary nowadays you know used to we just always think oh you talked to old-timers and they'll tell you about you know what used to be but it's not like that anymore you literally see changes in like you know in a year especially like sometimes like our kelp forests and stuff out here you know it's not the old guy telling you stories it's literally youngsters it can tell you like Oh last week last year when I was there I mean we had kelp and this year there's none so did you see did you kaylynn did you watch our our planet yet what do you even do at night please even like our planet every one of you yeah I have I'm stylized first I skipped all the ocean ones before I did all those moves first okay I mean to you exactly I'm almost like yeah you actually called me go hey have you seen this I'm like I'm watching it right now the walrus one was then what was that it was at the Arctic or something I almost cry or did you cry yeah it's Britain Peter Margot were like we did we thought they were gonna like I don't want to spoil it I saw a clip today released where they're like falling off the cliffs oh thanks for ruining it so this guy used to be ice there probably yeah and now they're just like and they have bad yeah so these walruses are like I want to go back and eat and then they just step right off these big waves like is that two feet or 200 feet and you think because they have like all this blubber like like Margo is like oh they probably just kind of bounce up and I'm right and then I like get back up and then no like they were just laying there and then the polar bears walk up you don't eat that didn't show so if you're gonna watch our flight at the Arctic we just give it away part of it yeah so you might wanna just it's still really beautiful everything is great I mean this time the footage they have is absolutely mind-blowing like the false killer whales and chasing the what is it spinner dolphins yak they were not spinning then and being typical ocean people I think Slater did the same thing I did we went to all the all the ocean one Sara there's the Arctic one there's the coastal waters was a deep of high seas yeah high seas or something and then there's a freshwater one to that that to the dolphins and off of Florida or off the Gulf what is it oh yeah yeah making those little circles and the ones that they catch the mullet yeah I'm all it's it's like they do these like mud bubble nets and then the fish I'll jump out and they're catching I'm like yeah can you imagine I feel like if I got one of those shots I'd be so like yeah I'd be done I could sign up but the waters Brown no it's like until they kick it out yeah yeah yeah yeah the neat thing about those dolphins and remember we were watching I was telling you now the only did they do that but that's also that around that area where they drive him up to the beach too so those dolphins have gotten smart over there and you know techniques to catch mullet cool so cool yeah I think driving them up to the shallows is like a typical thing for them because when I was on my manatee I swim and they were driving mullet you know up towards the shore not getting actually here I could even see them but I can hear the the clicks really at one point I can see it but then eventually you know I ignored them and then you know remember swimming back to the boat I actually be able to hear the click so techniques over there is there only pretty much bottlenose off Florida or do they have like any like oh sure yeah that one that washed up in the Everglades was actually one of those one of the well would it be 32 now they estimate today I googled it and I'm pretty sure there was a humpback that washed up there before in-floor there somewhere wrong turn it's on the migration route for the North Atlantic come back urban yeah yeah yeah oh speaking of whales moving through Florida talk about your are you mad gosh did you see her light up the right whales they've been seeing off of Provincetown Massachusetts supposed to show up in May when she well I mean they could show up whenever they want but they need to wait for me I will be there in two weeks hopefully they're still there when you get this guy to you let's go Margot's birthdays May 1st she don't she'll love to see right we want to go yeah I'm saying let's just go maybe ok finest it find us in Provincetown everybody Stacie someone needs to watch my dog yeah while you're at it will you feed my fish later senior minutes what no my room I have a betta fish secrets they are able to breathe so this later and I both have beta fish-- in mine makes a bubble nest and like regularly and once later found that out he was very mad yeah mine look how elegant mine is pretty gracefully I mean he is pretty pretty graceful it's pretty chill so anyways but yeah back to the right Wells I'm mad cuz they saw them breaching from the beach yesterday and I just want to be there already so mostly I'm just having fun well what's usually the prime time to be there towards the East Coast for your right whales I think like April May normally but things have shifted so much the last few years it's kind of hard to know what's normal mm-hmm but I also saw some whale watch trip reports from Boston and Gloucester that they're seeing some say whales which is also what I want to see that'd be cool I've never seen one I've never verified seeing one before I think I saw one a couple years ago but we never got a good shot at the head yeah hopefully they'll still be around when you get there I hope so or I'll just take trap feeding humpbacks too I mean that's fine it lanta quite side dolphins Jamie I know you're listening to this so this is my like wish list so Caitlin tell people explain trap speaking to people yeah so the humpback whales on the East Coast so later seen it too right the ice like this they just like stick their PEC fins well they have like rings oh there's our mouth yeah there but I think that's really too like slow down or something weird I don't know they kind of sweep it into them out there vertical in the water with their mouths open just right at the surface but most of the bottom jaws below the surface and they use their PEC fins to kind of sweep the fish and water into their mouths and then they just slowly ascend and slowly slowly close their mouth and then they trap all the fish inside I think that video of what I'm doing like really weird yeah they do know if it's open there's something they think they might have a saw even in our area right last year from a couple years ago that went around again last year that yeah get someone to consult on and then one time I had a calf do that I think I don't think it was trapping I think it just didn't know how to close its mouth yet yeah like I'm at a lunch feed like oh the fish swam I don't know what those Brutus whales in Thailand they're famous for that trap group trap yeah yeah we'll see I'm excited it sounds like things are pretty exciting over there I hope it lasts for another time a lot of good sightings for people all around the world yeah hey we haven't even done our have we done our own trip reports yet know what have you guys seen I think I got blown off the water for later tell everyone about our 51 day it was oh by the way this is April 8th 8th 1982 yeah most of CA fifty one's even born yet you know I do know that stars 60 well yeah she's old but she's the mom she was born in the eighties probably oh yeah no she's in the first book what did I say 60 to 80 but the kids weren't born yet she was in blue planet yeah she was really the original one well that's attacking the gray well no way yeah I know that and so is um 51a and I think Orion's like a little baby that was in the late 90s you know what's so funny though some of these famous wells have been in that you know what it took me until like last month to realize that that was j-pod in the beginning of Free Willy small because she's a baby youngster how many years could she be a baby well when I saw her in 2011 or 12 she was still yellow off of Santa Cruz Island thanks mom like she looks like her brothers are monster-sized yeah oh yeah huge I don't want to talk about these whales why because everybody down south thinks are there well isn't it oh whatever think they'd own whales that's easy we don't get to see them that I don't I feel like we don't see the 50 ones that much anymore no they were yeah they've been kind of around less the last few years and we've been seeing Emma's group a lot more than one 40s but no have you ever seen those killer whales that they saw on Santa Barbara the ones willing to yeah those they're very rare you might have the two in there but on females yeah and juveniles look at Adams picture that's not them it's a 27 I think it's the 51 and don't wanna see oh no yes so explain why there's 51 A's and there's one and there's okay so the 51 originally was star which is the mom and then her four kids and her oldest kid is a girl and her when she had her own baby so there started to be grandbabies in the pod the pod was getting too big and so they're not as stealthy when they're big right when the big group of whales traveling around it's a lot more noisy it's a lot harder sneak up on prey so after the second baby in the 51 days they split off and made their own group want to be cool they're all together they do all get together sometimes that would be like the shy if you can get all the fifty ones together a family reunion yeah I'm talking like also with the 51 A's runs a whale that's not related to them I think it's 49 sea for a long time there's been some speculation if that's a sprouter or if it's just a female with a really tough in so there are a group of four but three of them it's like 51 a and her two kids there's a chocolate murderers in the murder murder they like hitting Birds yeah mer hacky-sack that's what we saw last summer way back like Blue Planet days so late 90s 50 and her kids used to go with the fifty ones do you think liners like y'all it's my sister or not minor I mean you think Orion's like with my sister oh yeah when they all get together I'm sure they're like you know grandma you know siblings and all that cuz the little babies are the branch that stars grandma yeah stars got to be pretty old yeah the first when I first saw bumper he was small mm-hmm that was only like five years ago yeah I'm smaller and his it was really hurt it was yeah I felt like it was leaning more now I take the law yeah no it was curled over on the top more with that Nick has been there for Abbas a big rip he's had it since he was like maybe yeah it's really weird probably from a boat you think it'd be like oh that seems like that top not cheaper treats no it's like it's like a rip when he was you know it's a rip he got it I think during a gray well season one year and I think is probably from like getting in the mix of the oh and girls have barnacles you know they can like totally scratch the killer all right yeah yeah I've got some I got access to some pretty old pictures of him and yeah you can see that it's really weird I don't know why yeah the top part of the notch or whatever it is but roots out and then still kind of does that he a big boy yeah and his fin yeah every time you look at him every time yeah I was telling them I was telling Eric later that one year they came down after being gone for they'd been sighted in BC and then like a couple weeks later they were in Monterey and bumper had like four huge streaks through his left eye patch which healed over he doesn't have him anymore but he had this rake mark through his left side of his head and I was like holy mom so I just wondered what do you guys think about the feeding preferences of our pods because that was darkness later about this it seems like the fifty ones even when I saw him back in Long Beach are always going after dolphins sea lions yet Emma's pods when we see her out here it seems like it's always this time of year and it's always great well yeah it seems like I've seen amiibo oh she was nothing it was just like nothing but very well for her pod ya know her group the last few years has been like the first on the scene for any gray whale attack and they've gotten really efficient like I was telling some of the older skippers I was like I've seen Emma's pod take down and gray well in less than 40 but what about the fifty ones have you guys seen the fifty ones take down the gray well no I've seen them in the area or like as part of it or feeding after the fact but I've never actually yeah I've never actually seen them hunt but that's I mean obviously they're document yeah because I'm looking back in there my records here and it doesn't look like I'm just have leeway you know that video posted of the you know the Pacific white-sided dolphins that I got from the drone yeah first moved here years ago yeah do you I wonder who that what that pod was I was actually on vacation when you got that I know was on the boat yeah someone might know actually let of someone I never let people usually like hold my camera take pictures not be like and I mean friends I'll give you my camera yeah like like someone is this I can I use your camera taking some photos and this kid got or as I say you got a breach on my king you got no you didn't get a breach you got him hitting the white side out oh nice no you today I'm just kidding it's not mine no what are we gonna do so I just like let it be somewhere yeah yeah but I got it from the German which was cool the photo I have of the killer old backflipping hitting the common dolphin in the air from 2015 with that was the 51 A's but yes most of the gray whale attacks I've seen in the last few years has been instrumentally the ca1 40s but lots of whales will come in and eat after the gray whales are dead yeah so they definitely all have their preferences probably yeah and I think you know some some prey it's like it takes a certain level of specialization to hunt especially like dolphins because they're so fast so you really have to be organized to take something down like that elephant seals too cuz they're big and they can actually hold their breath longer than a killer whale and out dive them I think when they take down dolphins though they try to do as quick as possible because I think they try to break it yeah because the sea lion I mean they let that sea lion sit there for freaking 45 minutes that's what you teach your children how to eat okay you think they're still teaching comment baby dude come on if you can't learn not even eight years bro like okay they just let the sea lion and like they were just kicking it and head-butting it like for a forty five minutes but the sea lion was still alive mm-hmm like if they wanted to kill they just killed it yeah they could have killed it like the first time they saw it yeah no I think they did that to you know workout practice then it got up against the inside of the boats hull the catamaran oh really the sea liner is just sitting there they were coming in between I've had him do that where I almost wonder if they like do it on purpose so they can practice how to maneuver the sea lion away from the boat again since I've had him I got to do with gravity I don't understand they can just grab it have you guys seen that photo of the harbor seal and the killer rose mouths yeah mm-hmm oh yeah it's pretty crazy it looks really sad it makes it it makes it harbor seals seems to have all that you know of a young elephant seal it like somehow it got away from the killer whales for a second from the fifty ones and it just like pops up and you just see these huge eyes looking at the boat and I just like was silently filming like oh no and then Orion just came and just drags it under and it just like elephant still looking at you god this is really sad I honestly think that the fifty ones know they're putting on a show yeah yeah they've always been pretty active and they called them they always call them like the friendly park friendly pod yeah so this this particular day that man Slater hi um it was pretty awesome that I mean we knew they were around and there's like what 20 yards away from us there's a sea lion and I'm telling our passengers so that ceiling right there is either the dumbest sea lion in the world or bravest not literally right when I got down with that porpoise out here yeah we were all in like a perfect circle spread out formation all the boats we were just all looking different directions and this sea lion and I wasn't about the people already and I was like this you know I was like you guys keep our eyes right on the sea line next thing you know wow like yeah right on cue yeah pop up in there like that you're like oh he's done and it's like it's a weird it's not a normal way see lines pop up like they pop up in like you know swim bats one way like this things stayed there and like they stick their head underwater ya know they're doomed they're like where's it coming from I don't get why they don't know how to run like I mean they can they're done yeah yeah I wish it would kill them a little bit faster more but you may be more also ones it even I feel like they jump more they celebrate that's true they do they party after they eat so are we gonna see more killer hauls this season or it's gonna be the worst so well we're coming up on the peak right now this is when it starts to get really good mid-april the last two weeks of April and the first week of May but we haven't seen any gray well calves I mean our fleet out here I think it's been what one concern so I think of a very welcome they had one two days ago now in Newport so maybe it's gonna be here like today or tomorrow yeah has there been any good reports from no I know the census I think they finally had a few is that too much stop swimming at night but yeah last few days went fifty ones partial partial pod sighting of the 140s if I don't know which individuals and they say after May yeah we had been May 15 yeah May we had some good ones and then yeah Safin was in the area yesterday so they're round around they're waiting for someone to get a gray well all them are like lurking near the area I bet also my all day trip on the 24th I'm just saying promotion time no it's already sold out but is it really yeah I'm just saying can you come by at least for a little bit it's what number will you have a second they say that we really ate this I wish they weren't because people were messaging me so there's only been eight northbound cabs reported as of April 13th Wow they're they're late they said there wasn't any of them in the lagoons everyone I hear saying there were they're probably like we don't want to have any more kids we've had so they also just came off of like three year after year after year was like record-breaking numbers of at some point these females are like listen we're taking a year off okay like margarita yeah like we're just coming down here to party okay we're not trying to have another calf break but also there's a lot of thin whales - so I wonder if some females are like no no I don't have the resources to to get pregnant definitely could be but that our humpbacks are coming back in good numbers Rizzo sightings have been really good they were already almost to the point where I feel like we're gonna start passing you had a really great encounter with northern right well dolphins you kind of talked about it a little bit when we had Kate last week oh yeah you finally got your quality I didn't get my shot yet geez greedy no I yeah being inside like a little side yes you can get do you want a rainbow in the background - no idea corn next to it I just come on you know there's a shot that you want yeah you know what mine is I kind of only go up to San Francisco and visit those humpbacks there you want to take pictures of garter snakes I never did that mission accom yeah I got my San Francisco garter snake oh I just want to see right well I don't have to take a picture of it I just want to see it no pictures there didn't happen so I mean I would also like to take a picture of it but if I had to pick I would be okay with Jesse I can't believe how spoiled Laura we're talking about like getting a amazing picture of a dolphin that some people don't know exists did you notice that lady we oh was it the second trip we had a lady come out today who's never seen the ocean that was the first trip you said to me in the office yeah I was amazing I love that people cuz you know how we see like I was thinking oh yeah she was pretty happy so so many people have been like I've never been on the ocean floor I'm like wow wow and you're like you feel like you like check some bucket list the other one is when you see folks that are like like in the baby boomer generation that come out and they see a blue whale and they're like when I was a kid in there girl yeah but now the drains know they told me I'd never see her I've never seen one now yeah yeah that one is a good one too but they're like extinct they really think yeah they think there's none left yeah hey you know this is a good time to throw out this really random question maybe some of our listeners can help I think I talked to Slater about this long time ago I've always heard heard this fat's yeah I can't find where it comes from that someone came up with this figure that only 1% of the world's population has ever laid eyes on the blue I said that to you yeah we were wondering where did that come from you know one of the captains you say on my vote I mean I would believe it yeah is anyone have any reference to our world and then think of how many times you see a blue whale seasick on the boat that's like a significant portion of the world's population exactly the same like ain't coming again yeah listener so you know if you know any other use my whiteboard in my house will do some math we'll figure it yeah so if anyone knows where that came from well that's no but I think believe it's true now I tell people that a fraction of 1% like maybe like a quarter of a percent of the world's population have seen these whales okay you know the blue whale video I posted a couple days ago yes that's my favorite blue you're on the boat that day okay so that I posted it and I did I did more of like a I said that blue else could take over ten thousands but ten thousand gallons of water in their mouth it's more than I know I know I said I was being nice because I I don't know but if you google it it'll say $15 or more yeah okay my favorite thing about that encounter is when Slater was flying the drone oh yeah there's a really big mouth do you think you could park a car in there actually you could my favorite part is what he did afterwards he photoshopped his own face my favorite thing I laugh so hard sometimes I'm scrolling through my camera roll I stumble across that gem and I have a good laugh about it everything that girl again we were at that meeting Kayla member Hopkins and yeah it seems like that figure about blue whale intake is as close it she said twenty one thousand twenty one thousand that was the last I heard so the gold book in lab is actually working on that right now like that's exactly what they're doing is to the biomechanics of feeding in roar wall so looking at how does that throat pleat expansion happen how much water is going in there how much energy does that cost how does it change their speed when they're feeding and that movement of the mouth opening in the blue is a lot like I think it's a large largest biomechanical movement of any Libya could you're out there pretty closer right yeah they've said for years now any animal that's over 65 feet long doubles its body volume when that cavity is filled with water oh geez yeah humpbacks are so quick at letting the water out they're like no lunch feeding back yeah oh it out but where a second soon I have a seriously like a two-minute video of a blue well after like from that one tree yeah where is he still like on its side like bone blue yeah like letting bubbles of water out yeah yeah oh not bubbles the Catlins of bubbles water streaming out through the yeah actually there was a quick figure was it like hundred twenty-five percent of their body weight in water and curl and the single golf with a blue something like that did you guys see Chelsea mayor's those are beautiful so at first I was like like you know it's very beautiful but I didn't realize the outline the outline of the fluke is perfect and like the waterfall yeah that's freakin sweet yeah guys want to see the photo oh I shared it I think I've shared it on our story or no I sure do yeah yeah by the way I'm gonna I want to start sharing people's like things around the world that Wade or remind us to talk about it - yeah yeah but nice shot Chelsea and she also had a shot go viral the other day of a new staff member they have down at Newport Landing sitting on the bow of one of their bow yeah Delaney that was pretty cool pretty cool photo yeah that's awesome there's a white-sided dolphin bow riding and then Delaney sitting there with her camera and so it's really nice and then Kristin got that basking shark and then now la Dee's got the basking shark and they now add today got the basking shark so there I just want him to come to my eyes on a hot streak he got the residents the next day he goes first day he got northern right well residents in Monterey goes back home he gets those one rare yeah that 122 122 yeah these basking sharks also be good he's he's on a hot streak at they love him yeah tomorrow's this guy's later he's gonna get I'm basking sharks don't I want to come no I have to be at the shop by myself all day I feel sick yeah I'm on about yeah no you guys definitely gonna see something so many basking shark ocean conditions don't look at all the colors to myself win waves in the morning I guess yeah well you know it's like well yeah told you dang no basking sharks for you tomorrow oils don't care about the weather no they definitely do not hey guys with you what what's your favorite well questions you have any you ever gotten do the whale still come out in the rain hmm you know I'm just gonna ask you guys i straight-up say a ruthless answer to people on the phone I'm umbrellas I'm like you know the whales already live in water so they don't care yeah but I'm telling you I think the I'd be bummed water kept getting my blowhole dude they're exhales so fast it doesn't even matter inhaled just as fast oh whatever I got worried about them about one day when I started hailing really bad very exactly they really did stayed out for a while and that's exactly what captain Nick said is like everyone's like someone's like hey they're getting pelted really hard Nick actually said that he's like yeah you would stay down longer tube you got ice down your nose okay do you think our whales ever been hit by lightning yes I have someone that well we'll never know I don't know I feel like that was documented somewhere I don't have a paper on whales can hit it okay that we're gonna have to look that up now I feel like it's more likely that a lot of dolphins I feel like a sperm whale because they log at the surface they lay at the surface so long yeah but I feel like a dump out of dolphins like and come on you're getting but they're up and down so quick back underwater really quick yeah what if it hits the water near like a huge pot it would like we just go through the like be safe out there dolphins yeah there's lightning cuidado well this is also a time of year insider information that it's really nice to watch northbound gray whales from Big Sur Eric saw a harbor she'll give birth did you actually see the full birth oh yeah yes walk there without leading the whole thing is pretty pretty gross so that's I it was pretty gross is pretty bloody and what's funny is I got to ride on time the like part of this seal was actually already out and the gulls that hang out and that real crazy you know what to look for because they eat they eat the afterbirth and so I saw the gold freaking out oh this is happening I got there right when I got there I would run into that yeah how many years have I lived here trying to water birth at that dang rookery and I've never seen one should I see Lucille missio pops out these dolls are ruthless they just start pecking at the afterbirth and if you look closely at my pictures you can still see the sack yeah and what's amazing it's how alert the little seal is Lilly right on mom its eyes are open or looking around how they take their parents whim within the first like six hours usually yeah so it was quite amazing I'm gonna clean off yeah yeah well Eric saw harbour seal give birth there's a video of that yeah that one isn't that don't they have one like the Monterey Bay Aquarium I gave birth like right in front or was itwas otter twice it happened in December and then it happened again in like February there was two different births right there at the great tide pool they do it on land huh mm-hmm that's crazy yeah I thought about video but people don't watch my videos I mean they watch like good well made stuff like like Slater more from the big sir and we're going to look for harbor seal birds and big that was a big sir that was here huh no I know we're gonna go look at Hopkins but we're also gonna Big Sur to watch northbound great whales no I'm gonna wait for them to get to Monterey fine I'm going without you okay you don't even have time okay you're gonna go say you go down right you go down see these gray whales down there and then you're like I gotta try back up because what if there's killer whales here and you're not gonna have service down there to know that this killer whales in the base I know you're gonna miss everything just to see the north not very well that was a small snapshot into a daily conversation between beans later your brain to look for whales you should look for them on the boat during this time here whatever weird cool things that we seen so we talked about fifty ones eating the sea lion baby harbor seals and if you guys live out here in the Central Coast yeah that's a neat place to hang out right there next to Hopkins marine station what do they start having that all the we're seeing sunfish a lot if you feel like lately but whenever you start seeing like all the baby sunfish where there's death row in like frisbees [Music] early summer also through the fall they're still like dinner plate sized but we need more jellyfish I heard someone said they stopped by the wind sailors yeah we actually have seen a few out there further out you see more yeah I took a picture of them like the day before the fifty ones I think and there was like tons but then they had like millions washed on shore somewhere in Santa Barbara or something yeah so they're showing up and then nettle wise there's been a few nettles out there but not like in the big Big W back again and summer yeah last year they started showing up in like June okay so she cover the hardware to be filled again and then when nettles show up then we could get our letter backs also I want to see a turtle we said so many last year say remember all those turtles we saw as so such bad FOMO anyways yeah summers coming soon somebody just send me a leatherback sea turtle and a basking shark in the same trip and I I'll be happy I'll stop watching the same thing so basking sharks are like whale sharks yes when around a mouth open get brown yeah and take a whale shark an important class of shark had a baby and it was a basket all the spots asked him what if they're related it look way different yeah they do their body plan is way different their head is different are they literally doing the exact same thing though almost modified like everything are they defeating on the same type of thing yeah plankton but their temperature tolerance is different because basking sharks can be spotted like way up the coast like basking shark I'll add it to you well really cool water yeah ok yeah area that you can actually go a snorkel with them I don't think it's snorkelling actually I think it's dry suit videos with kayakers and stuff too in the UK seen basket chair I wonder if you can swim with them like the well sharks they're like Jess's like but the visibility is horrible yeah wherever they're at there's not clean water huh yeah I want it but I wonder if it's the same type of thing no like if they're just like hmm just hanging out like the well sharks I swear they don't even like you could wave your hand over their eyes they're like this I think they really don't even like well they they're I guess they said they're just so hungry that they're not really yeah excuse me it could not be bothered yeah but like they really just come on when you see a seal or like a harbor seal or something look at you can totally tell it's looking at you you know or like a dolphin can turn one look at you yeah they don't have that same acknowledgement yeah well when you can't see both their eyes at the same time either their eyes are like so far on the sides there why they are what do they even think like they're like ah something's wherever there something's also wherever they're like they're like yeah the difference the same thing with like hammerhead sharks like how do they process visual information their eyes like they don't have overlapping range they're like big constantly have to do like everyone in separate fields everyone loves sharks maybe we should think about bringing in a shark person one day that's a good question yeah I mean we know we kind of have an idea why hammerheads have that hammerhead one for more sensitivity with those a MPA of horn Xena the sexes alike just sense electrical fields but yeah as far as our vision goes yeah having the eye so far apart weird isn't like what most predators have forward yeah facing eyes so interesting I wonder what it like you can see the same thing no because if you look at the way their eye sockets position outside their head they can see forward you think they look straight board yeah look at a humpback where do I sit sit sacktual ii projected a little bit out look at your pictures like that very well heck slapping yeah they still are pretty far different size their head that their thing I think they have like you know ours they do the same thing that you can't they don't like split off yeah chameleon control of that independent control no no that would freak me out that's making my brain hurt to think about it cuz my idea that was that you know like chameleons yeah chameleons can do it yeah yeah they're like straight up like one they're going all which ways they have independent control yes I talked to an Anatomy person yeah what do you need a scientist joy Joe yeah Ryden burg Joey knows everything about this little questions like that that's true guys watching we've met like at least 10 or 15 people that are listening the world more and more yeah it's awesome oh I did get some feedback from people so if you're looking for ways to watch or to listen to the podcast and you're having trouble with one of the platforms it is on YouTube and it is on Google podcast I know some people were saying they're having a hard time with pod bean and some spot yeah or if you don't have a Spotify account like YouTube's free - so don't ask us what why we can't get on iTunes because I don't understand why if you have it again if you have a tip on how to get your podcast on iTunes hit us up because we're struggling but it is not just some free platforms that are a little easier it would be like YouTube or Google podcast if you're looking for a way to listen to it still so listen to this they've already found a way well yeah I've had two friends tell me that I couldn't listen after so many episodes because they want me to have a subscription or something someone said that we're really quiet maybe I'm one episode we were really quiet because you're having a problem with maybe cool stuff yeah yeah because every time we're allowed will eventually get Mike's one day that are like more professional some day we're doing this for fun but yeah well maybe one day we'll get really dialed in and super pro sounded that's the goal all right well make sure you go well watching this month wherever you are yeah it sounds like it's pretty good in a lot of different places right now yeah guys and yeah like Slater said been meeting a lot of you guys keep keep it coming with comments questions and any other cool topics he might think about and we are kind of considering right now bringing in possibly more special guests when we you know meet people or think of people and stuff like that so you know any type of input that would be constructive you know let us know don't yeah I feel free to reach out to us and if you found us some other way make sure to follow us on Instagram yes it wale nerds yes it's been fun meeting you thanks for saying hi when you're in our area I like when you come whale watching yeah I love it too it makes me feel almost famous alright guys thanks so much for listening hope you all have a great day or night and we'll see you on the next episode thank you bye guys

-

hello everyone and welcome back to the well Nerds podcast this is episode number 17 I have Eric and Caitlyn here with me hey everyone hello and we have a special guest today a real special one his name is Adam Ernst er what's up guys he's our number one whale nerds man only person that's listened to all 16 episodes I think must listen to all of them at least no one's told us that they've listened to everyone and asked us when the next one's coming out going down to one day week except for Adam dude what am i doing my Thursday nights watch TV show why did I do homework all those downloads are from you right you download every device alright so the reason we're having Adam on the podcast he's not only a marine life photographer but he also works on a whale watching boat in Santa Barbara you just started working there right yeah so I started working there late January so it's the Condor Express in Santa Barbara I think of it as the only like legitimate boat in Santa Barbara that'll take you out whale watching obviously there's Island Packers down in venture which is pretty close to us he's claiming he's claiming it but like yes we have a big old boat and fit 127 people got a grill on board so you can eat right now we're doing I ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on that boat did you off the grill off the grill right she might have toasted I don't know you've been there a long time yeah years ago she's probably been there for like eight years yeah Condor Express has some history too that's the technique here on the second Condor yes the original Commodore so if you're in the sport fishing industry some of you might know that old boat yeah so Adam is not he didn't really get on the podcast because he is a marine photographer anything it's because today told us that he's had a record he claims he's claiming that he has the best one week of worth well sightings and we want you guys we want him to share with you one week all in one week maybe two weeks yeah it was all in one right no it was like it though he really did I mean yeah and they're all talking about it last yeah last podcast just a little bit what you saw like what we saw yeah or what well because some of it alright hit him with first thing you saw okay so odd quarter let's see I came up here what's the day in the time no give him no I need the date what was the position of his son when he was with us right was with you is the northern rival dolphins does the first time I ever saw them how crazy because you know seeing them is one thing I mean like they're like they look like little weird alien little thing how long did you cry for they're from another planet but like sea lions but like seeing one of them be cool but like seeing a thousand right did you get him on your first time at the stand that's later he it took him a while to get it it takes everybody a lot of time to you know see them like once every like three months the flavor was getting pretty mad at those well and I was there by themselves and I was a huge part I was like a Friday right and they stampeded yeah those are Friday and then was it the afternoon trip or was it the next day Lucy well Saturday we saw just lunge feeding humpbacks I was supposed to spend Friday here Saturday here and I supposed to go back Saturday night to work in the Condor but I did in Maui fire I call my captain I was like hey I'm gonna stay an extra day he's like that's fine paid off um so it really paid off as we saw you see l-pod the southern resident killer whales and knives I've seen j-pod before and 2016 I saw granny right before she passed away where did you see them at Monterey you saw the memory no no mark yeah a pod in San Juan Islands if I was in San Ramon so you saw southern resident killer whales in Monterey yeah which is how many miles was it which we covered all this I mean well cuz Eric and I saw them because from here to Oregon Washington borders like 900 also I gotta clear something up on that podcast you said you're sitting in the galley JJ turned the boat and you just like stood up and like just went to the went to the wheelhouse the wheelhouse but in reality we both looked at each other went no way and then you okay well the way I got and I was like what is it and then I we were both like it was like no like what and there's no one's like okay I I knew what was going on cuz soon as I got in the house I could hear the radio but then I walked back out to the galley and what'd I tell you he's really dolls porpoise going along with it like that they were black and white Wichitas and we said they go fast and both can go fast so basically he saw northern right whale dolphins and then he saw the southern resident killer whales which we talked about however that wasn't crazy cuz then what and then I went back to Santa Barbara and I saw the rarest transients on the planet they're not the rare that's a rare pie Vaman let's call it an for Santa Barbara or Santa Barbara like we see killer whales there maybe like once or twice a year yeah yeah they do get some really good it was like a mini Monterey well it's a cool barber school because you get stuff coming up from the south and also stuff from like the north yeah cuz they sometimes get we get dolls porvis there we get northern right whale dolphins there and so we also get like false killer whales the funny thing is when you read field guides the cutoff for animals usually yeah but I said about Point Conception is a point position north of Point Conception yeah so it's really honestly a queer oh yeah so you saw the killer rose and then what you see so we saw this CA 122 transients and one thing about that is that you know we talked to ELISA the Orca researcher here and she said you know CA 122 herself was not there was not there and at least not based on your photos at least not based on the photos and there was six killer whales there that's awesome yeah so you know we don't really know where she was if something happened to her or if she just pieced out for a bit and then she also said that there's two new calves that's ours calves that happen how many well sort of was it there was six whales how big were the calves they look like are they still rhenium orange he was a little bit orange he had an orange tinge to him the littlest one but she said I think the older calf she had seen before but then the young calf that nobody had seen before interest all she's gonna look at her catalogs and stuff but I'm kind of predicting that there's a lot of toddlers right now because 2016 was such a big year for feeding and there's a lot of whales around so there's a lot of mating happening yeah so 18 months after that there was a lot of births and then it's pretty cool to see such a rare pilot and the once again it's like where did it go yeah exactly and so yeah that part is supposed to be to females and then to juveniles did she tell you where the last time they were seen no it's been we did see them during the big year in 2016 for sure we may have seen them after that but we definitely saw them just a few years yeah if you need to go up to Santa Barbara hopefully they're still there with that yes is there it's kind of cool that like you know we have like the fifty ones everybody knows their names we have Emma's pod and whatever I think jackets groups been cited they often - like the one 22s they don't have names they don't have really ID numbers like only one 22 has an ID number her daughter which I saw doesn't have an ID number it doesn't have a name and then obviously they were born after the catalog was made is that why you gotta log was made in like 1994 right yeah you think that like somebody would I guess I gotta update the catalog but yeah yeah it'll happen so that was really cool and then what you see after that after that I saw false killer whales wait that was the app the actual next thing falls killer whales out yeah so it was kind of crazy we you can't see anymore things in a road that had the name killer whale in them no pay me killer whales yeah sure thing no you can't see too many in a row that's not that's not how it works okay now so what it would happen false killer all day so it was eating it was it was no they're just traveling it was interesting though because we do three two and a half hour trips a day and on the morning trip we were like two hours in we saw absolutely nothing and then we saw this one humpback that was like doing headstands it was really weird it just like would take its tail out of the water and just like throw it around kind of cool and then it started logging so we hung out with that thing and then in the distance our captain captain Dave he's the man he saw like you know we thought the captain Dave shadowing captain Dave so we thought they were offshore bottlenose and then I like took a picture like probably like a mile away and zoomed in and I was like those are pretty curved dorsal fins and so we went over them when it went over to them and they were false killer whales so there was about 20 and so cool which is really cool and you know a month prior in March like March 5th or something I had seen false killer whales for the first time in Long Beach and that was a pot of 50 and I was looking through the photos there's a few that had specific like you know cuts and notches and their dorsal fins and the second time I saw them in Santa Barbara none matched up I mean it was definitely a different pod oh definitely a smaller pot as well yeah we do know what those false killer whales that same pods will visit the same areas for example was it three years ago I think you might have gone over it there is one a 2014 one that gave birth off of that was after I'd made a point yeah and that pod you know after Gabe everyone of course paid attention to that mom and calf and good ID photos and then was it like a year later they came back yes it seems like they cover this area year later yeah exactly no stuff that we don't know yeah but dude like they can't be on the dot sometimes yeah they are they can't be like Google calendars like tomorrow is one of those days out of the year in Monterey Bay where you almost always see killer whales for the last ten years all right it's gonna be bonkers yeah Caitlin called it see what happens tomorrow no 28 so Adams now seen northern right whale dolphins southern resident killer whales in Monterey false killer whales no super rare transients oops and now he got as his non cetacean sighting all right so I know we saw a basking shark the other day Santa Barbara that's it you only fell one we saw one so Island Packers which is about south of us and Ventura apparently reported em they reported 20 in one day across their three boats there's three circling or bow and there's like at least like eight or ten dorsal fins and that's amazing which is insane I think back yeah I think the population of them is like 500 700 lottie's like the shark whisperer when I first met her we saw like like a 15-foot white shark so ever were to go she sees like these amazing things she can really like I wanted to send them up to me fifty once twice in two weeks yeah sure like she's got really good luck too so you know that was cool obviously basking sharks are the second biggest shark on the planet like a prehistoric whale shark yeah a second yeah second largest that's so cool yeah so like like 25 feet they're so big yeah now I haven't in the wild the baby angels that sinned Adams been down to the bahia de los angeles right yeah so i did research there on microplastics one year and then whale shark identification research which I gotta go back and return to and continue at some point don't forget to a take your friends with you when you return there ya know honestly you guys silver shark is that you one with no so yeah that's how I met him he my Community College has a field station down there though my college in a Calif in the states actually that has a field station out of the way dude you can do it it's they spend two weeks it's like 800 bucks for two weeks down their travel food housing has everything paid for and anybody can do it you know to be a student you have to be uh extra units like a seventy year old lady come down with us one time oh cool so really cool so if you're in Southern California definitely look into that Glendale Community College Baja field studies so yeah Simon Dale that's where I live in LA that's where I'm originally from oh but now you guys yes and now I just transferred to UC Santa Barbara oh okay awesome I didn't know you were from Glendale awesome yeah man so yeah basking shark was rad they look like dinosaurs like it's yeah it's really crazy they're like they're like skin texture it was kind of sad because we had crappy lighting and you couldn't really see him for pictures at least it's so cool to know that it's right there it's just seeing that was just really really cool yeah check those out none of you none of us a VM right no I think and those are those are filter feeders so usually yeah yeah they can be seen all the way up and like you're up I mean I don't know that Scotland has a Scotland has a local program yeah snorkel program there yeah speaking of snorkel programs and Churchill Manitoba I think is a oh yeah yeah yeah I met this guy on Instagram that runs trypsin there does that he does polar bears and then and the offseason I don't know if it's the same season but then he does the beluga trips that's cool I want to see all the white animals up there polar bears Beluga you guys had to choose one cetacean to see forever or to be what kind of animal would you be you see no I'd be about as well actually I want to be if in a well because they go everywhere ahead but ice I mean that's kind of cool but and you live I want to I want to travel more of the ocean you don't know that food whales don't live as long as a bowhead whale true do you people know that yet no they don't count the Rings weren't they doing it I thought they were like doing that you know how they were I mean and what does the book that we read by almost yeah they do Delaney okay yeah that often are fin whales accessible dead news yeah and how do you know if it's at its oldest range dive hole de-ager did I have something else whatever science science so wait I would be a fin whale she's not bad thing that would be cool they can't check age with that says no they don't have the DNA processing down good enough they're trying though they're actually trying to do that through DNA to figure out how old are we crazy but when they ground truth it with the humpback whales in East Coast right so do you think about that see a 189 you gotta be able to tell something from that booger if you would have gone and picked it up yeah Bob your analyzation yeah Kleenex so one more citation in the life that we could see only one more we know like what's that like the top of your bucket list oh uh okay right well yeah right well for me to any right well I'll be happy easy ten grand I don't know we need fresh faces yes you're living on the living off the land did I what else forage South Africa these lines actually yeah what no I'm serious yeah lions are gonna be okay let me tell you guys something this is one of the hardest questions I think I've ever been asked I don't know what I want to pick to see like there's so many on have you seen the freaking poster just came on dude I'm surprised nobody said vaquita cuz they're gonna be gone oh speaking of makita I'm trying to be like sad the rest of my life but like you'd be like one of the people that have insight inside word is from someone that at NOAA was saying that it might be five to six single digits yeah it's in single digits now dude isn't that crazy how like last year they estimated thirty yeah okay happy thoughts I think I like 12 already yeah yeah there's a couple years ago yeah anyways I want to see a narwhal and right well I'm trying to see it right well in like week I want to see a bowhead whale and I think oh no I want to see those freaking dolphins that are doing their mullet feeding from out oh there's about those yeah Florida but those specific bottle I just want to see yeah yeah I want to see that like population I want to see Commerce ins dolphin I think or I think I want to see a lot of dolphins cuz they're just so weird yeah you're what you're why these those are cool they're just so bizarre hi I want to see everything on that oh yeah they're like Pokemon again right well it would be cool for me some of those ones in the Amazon the pink dolphins would be kinda cold our glass dolphin yes Hector's dolphin Dwight what's the what's the dolphin on the East Coast Oh Lana quite sighted or the white yeah and then that's in the white beaked dolphins I missed dude for the longest time pseudo or Co we're like the top of my list so now you got off sounds like we all want to see everything anyway there's someone if there's a company fall on Instagram another name right now but that they're like there's like this long open area of ice where the narwhal swim through because they need a path wait for it oh I mean they're an ocean but you know I mean yeah they wait so like people just sit in lawn chairs and watch the narwhals parade by great time I would not mind sitting in a lawn chair watching no I'm fine I'd like to sit with my feet on in the water and just like watch some snacks snacks watching bears I'll share miramanee no mm-hmm they're mine anyways okay transferred to UC Santa Barbara what are you studying I'm studying environmental science not marine biology everybody thinks marine biology which I was gonna do but I figure you know I end up working at some whale watch Cup but are the same forever yeah my plan is to you know once I graduate is to work for a condor for a few years get my captain's license and I don't know you hear that captain Davies coming for you he's getting those hours yeah environments ions I love that's pretty much the reason why I chose Santa Barbara's just because it's so close to the beach and the ocean and get that surfer vibe I gotta grow my hair do whatever need you that helps you study better Adams gonna become a photographer guys forget apologies photographer he's gonna get like a pseudo orca eating a dolphin an easy-bake oh my god never mind [Laughter] oh by the way did you guys know that false killer whales eat dolphins yes apparently I don't know why I don't know if it's just a different population than the Hawaiian ones yeah there's no spinners like fish - yeah you guys think that like like you know killer whales have like residents transients et Peas like do you think maybe I mean I think they're more like generalists cuz I also read somewhere that they had a they had a dead one wash up on a beach somewhere and they had a piece of humpback and its stomach or something really yeah behind that paper well actually in Mexico they see sudo Orca go after humpback calves exactly sometimes those rake marks on their floors are not or coders but so far like well watch boats have yeah like back down south we seen in the yellowtail white sea bass and then we had that documentary that's later was watching you know shows him chasing down spinners so pretty amazing here actually he just passed away a couple years ago that does a humpback whales in Cabo Oscar mm-hmm and his partner they've seen sea torque ago after humpbacks and sometimes there's fresh scars of the dudes of the humpback calves they're too close together to be actually interesting yeah pretty top predator now obviously they can they're not taking outcome yes have you guys like photo of the killer whale hitting a mom and baby sudo worker at the same time no shop Tatem deleting this right now delete this yeah that's a crazy shot somebody got it nowhere I mean killer whales are pretty crazy kill the real photos you showed Adam a killer photo I was I thought I was cool dad and I just hit him with some crazy side all these crazy sightings now a baby probably better weakened I've had for sure he did have a good week that's what happens to people do they come out like two times and then they end up seeing residents you know I mean yeah it's like well when you first move here it's like the greatest few weeks ever and then like a month later like it's gonna rain now I have a training no my first when I moved here do you member in November we had like orcas and yeah all sorts of stuff me too then it was winter and you were sad remember you moved here at the wrong time November right before the winter I had killer was four days or four days in a row and I moved here oh wow yeah gnarly you know attacks dolphin found interest almost as big as the moms almost as big as a killer I'm like pretty sure that's real that's actually taken from a video so but all things yeah if you're gonna Photoshop something is like I that's also I took a video of that encounter that's not my photo but I was there what the elephant seal getting tossed in there Tony there's some crazy stuff before we all moved here maybe you should move back to Newport and then move back resetting you know and Wales every other week oh my god it's like a Photoshop like okra Newport do you guys a Southern California in Santa Barbara have been really doing well I know they actually been really good whale watching all up and down the Cal just think that's like an actual like something actually is happening well I think that's more of them now yeah but the basking sharks is the best example show they used to be sighted in Monterey really often and now we never see them that's crazy and they're albacore to is a good example of course fishing is not the same in California anymore oh no yeah it was and John Campea is talking moon blue whales and how not that they're like you know the clock they're not declining they're moving more but they're spreading out more up and down the coast like there used to be like Tom's in Newport Monterey but now they're like kind of all up another coast I've been down the whole coast the pilot whales used to have off of Catalina oh yeah we actually talked about that kind of like Rizzo's they think are kind of taking over the knees yeah well that was a working theory but also they think that like because they said that about Monterey - they're like well we used to see pilot whales in the 70s and 80s and now it's all Rizzo's dolphins and that's like just anecdotal but it also sounds like maybe the pilot whale population either completely shifted range or decline majorly and there was a couple factor there was a couple factors yeah I did it at the workshop we were at the live cattle yeah yeah for the aquarium industry and then also competition with fisheries yeah bycatch they were the whole gillnetting situation there on certain company oh yeah and then also competition with the purse seine squid fishery yeah but they do show up like I've seen them a couple times in you know that's another one I gotta check out the book you go back behind the channels yeah guys you know usually chase him down bluefin and stuff or we'll see him back there I know John was still hearing them on the hydrophone every now and then - back there yeah when I was on the kalkhoff acres we saw on that point exactly yeah another I don't think Alisa identified these guys either we had another part of killer whales in Santa Barbara like two days ago yeah it was later brought that a few big males and more like five females there's a pot of seven wasn't that it wasn't much grouping Emma wasn't in there but Emma's not in there you don't think it was just the one 22s again no it's definitely not all those ones have no markings yeah but okay - 16s was all girls for a while yeah but - 16s is jagged she's pretty unmistakable okay although if she was not with them the rest of her pod doesn't have too many markings yeah was it the 51a Center Kim that's three it's just three females though right I don't remember it was a pod that you know the picture in the office mm-hmm the one that has the brake marks on the dorsal mm-hmm I don't know what that pod was yeah were you there that day last day I mean I can check my log science science no remember have you talked about your uh April Fool's thing yeah we talked about we talked like a borderline Arenas April Yap for another minute week or so first of the month give it you and nobody cared about me here and you totally got me yeah because we're good at it yeah we're really good at it against yeah yeah together and then let's later deliver it I don't know you got sending him stuff like we're seeing stuff oh wait you have the tram I Adam the black-and-whites are back here common Mercer everywhere the drive back up again another like two months we run around everywhere again yeah so when the chicks go off the nest with the dad the dad starts like feeding for them and then I think actually might be later than that then later in the summer they go flightless they lose all their primary feathers are the same time all summer we're gonna hear that's my best impression do you guys have come urgent a lot down there not really what US is it because we're close to the fair lawns we get a lot of pelicans you guys still have a lot of pelicans up here huh they just start showing back up again yeah clearly saw like my first one you're right yesterday the reason why you're seeing them year-round is because they actually nest right off violence yeah yeah and then we also have some yeah we also have some that will nest in Baja yeah I see a ton down there Baja but your true California brown pelican is usually classified as the ones that next challenge we can try laying their nest yeah that's scary also how does it get out of it it doesn't beak doesn't have a tooth thanks to breed reptiles - welcome to the reptile nerds no one likes she's gonna suck you in yeah suck on that nerds do you guys see how big that radish I grew was yeah it was pretty cool did you eat it no yes cage I like bunch of like different radishes and [Laughter] it's your fault iguanas I have a big iguana his name is big red I've had him for like six years what is he read the agree is indeed read he's a green that's red he's a green is red I used to have an albinos all this stuff nice that's crazy yeah they're cool must not continue talking about reptiles nice as yours yeah dude it's in my house and shoulders my dad's yes what do you feed it lettuce no this is very bad no they're vegetarians Yeah right yeah but they don't you let us see like kale collard greens all right back to the trip reports trip reports oh you guys are on the same boat yeah yeah awesome yeah so in Monterey it was very foggy and but it was calm so I was nice it was nice this morning yeah I mean right next to the boat he was a really friendly you're just sitting there like it seemed like he was believing then he was just right back in front of the boat again Kaylin did you see the double breach where's Justin I just caught it out of the corner of my eye flash I didn't see the whales we had breaches like that all day - it was like everyone that's funny how many wells you guys hump Lexi Cates yeah only two or three actually four because we saw two singles and a pair on our way in and then in the afternoon we had at least a dozen but probably closer to 15 or 18 all came together for lunch feeding session well I'm seeing like bird work and lunch feeding and then by the time we'd catch up to it it would fizzle out and then finally we got one before it was done and so they got the passengers got to see the lunch it's funny same thing same exact time the day before all the whales came together but there was a lot more bait on the surface today Apache anything else dolphins or anything hard report another first what albatross oh yeah albatross in the morning there's five of them yeah I heard on the radio that this morning I think it was Liz Liz who actually saw like a whole bunch of them out there to chill humpback and then I was in these albatross well hey did you guys hear there's been lace ons in the area yeah I heard that Kate saw it yeah yeah kids are so late sons have been in it you know we had a really rare sighting today oh yeah oh yeah what we picked up a blanket out of the ocean oh yeah this lady on the boat goes actually that's a Costco blanket like damage return or something definitely I'm returning this cuz it's wet and it has a hole in it from the gas i gapped it and it weighed like a billion pounds cause it's soaking wet oh yeah and we picked up a balloon today good job okay just one the blanket was the first one for me the central central part of Bay we actually started our trip just straight out to the the mile marker buoy and we had a stellar hanging out in front of Moss Landing stellar and then we had two huge humpbacks just kind of circling the front of Moss girls yeah big big girls and then we went all the way up to the SoCal Canyon there's probably a kid you know there are probably about 15 to 20 humpbacks feeding amongst birds over there we saw the lunging from a distance as we got closer of course you know typical fashion dissipated but tail throws they're pretty good and then on the way back we had some probably about 40 Rizzo's and some white started so you go through the fog again you got some stellar shots yesterday yeah have a stellar shot I just put up right now - yeah it was - back with the scars it's cursed did you see it oh yeah it almost looks like yeah yeah but we thought we thought today yeah that it was a parent or right next to each other and then the one one decided to do a chin slaps over and over again then the other one breached so close that I was on a hundred I could barely get it just barely got into the frame it was pretty cool it shows you how like we were all in the water and different boats well we're all one another and like yeah you know some dolphin some didn't we said when they're scattered out and your poor visibility you literally can miss them by like five hundred exactly yeah so but it's just crazy we were doing that typical travel yeah travel through the fog thing and then also I need smell I mean like go that way yeah yeah no morning trip especially smelling for whales in the Monterey Bay people don't believe us but you really do have to do that some days man I remember last summer I would just stand up on the cap rail on the front they do it let me stand up there and sometimes I'd be like stop stop I smell will ya hey so have you did you guys have sea lions with your animals today because it seems like we're some days with you but like only six okay I went for our typical summer you know where we have a couple hundred of them it makes it so easy for photographing yeah I think it'll get going you know I know what so when our humpbacks your feed with like a hundred hundreds of sea lions yeah the sea lions all go down but I guess it's just cuz they don't hold their breath right so they'll all go down but wherever the sea lions come up at is where the humpbacks are gonna come up next they're staying as close to the bait balls that yeah if it's and so what will happen is they'll all scatter and then you know that makes gonna legend we get that with or just come up next to them in general we're just like sheer water and stuff like when they're so full sometimes they just like sit on top of the bait balls yeah it's like there's so many patches of birds like that that yeah yeah last time I was here I just could not believe the amount of birds yeah it was yeah that wasn't even like and last year wasn't even a big bird year like I've seen I'm not even kidding five hundred thousand shearwaters in one flock yeah half a million she had that with me I think last serious later mean yeah we're Chris we were out there way out and there was like yeah yeah I remember crazy how just like along the coast of California every spot is just different yeah I can Santa Barbara if we spot birds diving we're like oh there's bait balls there there has to be a humpback there and like here you see him everywhere nearly there just like passing another babe oh no oh no oh there's one sea line working this one hey Adam so where you are when you are seeing these birds feeding is it anchovies or is it sardines anchovies it's anchovies oh that's good yeah pretty much every time it's anchovies okay did you guys have krill or something when there's basking sharks are just like poor visibility here I think basking sharks feed on phytoplankton yeah yeah this summer we get like huge blooms of of krill that's why we get tons of blue whales and fin whales mm-hmm eating in there in the summer off the Channel Islands we got a lot of Velella Velella the other day oh cool and then like that then like a couple days later when you got home there was like yeah because we had more do there on the ocean and then we just found this huge patch them and they eat phytoplankton as well I think it's had those tiny little tentative sailboats yeah so they're cool and so I was told that you know when you have big numbers of those it's gonna be a good blue season there what year was it there was a 2015 I work to calc offers mats of them all over the ocean like you for miles and my sister I'm down for some onesies know back to getting this ever oh yeah no no they're like you know what I'm talking about that shot with like 10 to 15 whales in one group and the same frame no like you know the blue whale the one I just posted like oh yea the lunch meeting blew out do you think it's going to vary see what happens yeah that's right no it's never gonna happen again dang it well it only can happen again if it's you and me on the boat about a fin whale yeah we have been Wells out here and we've seen on my sims yeah yeah sometimes a we have like in humpbacks all like all together yeah yeah never I was like Adam you don't want to play this game with us everywhere eat out here yeah this area so much food for every day we've had that - yeah I'm gonna you're in Santa Barbara I really wanted to be here for the blue whale you can transfer the UC Santa Cruz at it well I wanted to be here for the blue whale summer but I actually have another job in the same one that's more so how did you get a job up there so one of my buddies it's you know it's kind of crazy the power of Instagram like just this girl that followed me and works for a boat up there outer Island excursions she was like hey you shouldn't we have a job opening shoot you should apply for it so I didn't I got it yeah mm it's yes it's like the tender of 20 and like I can spend a summer up there and yeah yeah exactly like you're gonna trust me dude I went there one time and I was like mm okay but then you'll see when it's like not nice in the winter and you're like okay exactly I'm kind of glad yeah except for when it is nice during the winter there's still killer Wells there you just haven't made your foam oh it's all right doesn't mean know why they like cut it off during the winter because they nobody's going out no people they're the population drops way down there's some people just stay there in a summer that's worse come in the summer obviously we're not many people on the island yeah that live there yeah San Juan does have as many people as you think if your summer population to people that's awesome no I'm telling you just driving on the ferry alone from Anacortes to the San Juan Islands is like mind-blowing exactly first time you've ever been on a ferry yeah but I grew up there so I'm like yeah done organ no but like going up some yeah kid and stuff and like oh yeah Grey's Anatomy one of the doctors always goes on the ferry like to clear his mind have I ever told you about my San Juan like 2016 southern resident exciting no so it was me my buddies after I graduated high school we took a trip to Washington we were staying in Portland and we had a we went kayaking with killer whales like that's the thing you do they're kind of cool my parents and you guys actually see them in an app so sweet but the story of is kind of crazy he left Portland at like 2:00 in the morning to Friday 9 o'clock trip in the San Juans and on the on the way there we hit you know I didn't realize that Seattle traffic is literally like worse than LA trobe because the roads are gonna be late and I was like no any roads are set up for traffic no I was pretty bad that was really bad I was like no I wanted to see killer whales in the wild in my entire life so I was like flooring it literally like a hundred miles per hour and I got pulled over so we did I got that ticket so I got the ticket there I was like a hundred bucks and then as we were pulling up to the ferry it was pulling away and like my heart just you get let's just say you Florida and you just like you know this sucks I got old sad no problem song you know crying there's no other fairies so what I did was I called the local airport and I was like hey a plane can you take me the islands and they're like yeah so this gets ball in so I dropped like another like homie my buddies dropped 300 bucks 100 bucks yeah we saw the ferry I was like you know like what are the chances on a kayak you see killer whales we saw a pod I saw a granny before you know in 2016 uh-huh and just like a crazy experience I dropped like 300 hours more than I had to but yeah and you got a ticket at work made it worked out yeah you guys are gonna tell you something so Evan Adam and I were driving over here he went to pull in to know and like the next street over dude they're like this tiny car no no you did go straight up there like walls 2014 it's not even that low but like I just we're driving guys good I was like oh gosh you guys go out on the Condor Express make sure you buy adam's photo package hey so when you when you're kayaking with those does or could the that you have a big male swim by that's like one of my dreams yeah see look up to it they they weren't that close probably like 300 400 yards away okay yeah Washington safe yes and you know I've gone the kayaks what's that we've like lime kill where you on San Juan Island yes yes so you're unlike the backside yes so we're the lighthouses yes it was just crazy because you know like when you see them you have to get all the kayaks together or hold on to each other and you can't paddle towards them or anything oh it came pretty close and we had we had a baby breaching you know I wasn't really that into it back then so I didn't know I just said you know there's granny and that's that's what I really remembered so cool and I'd like this tiny little I have this clip from that trip of like a I had like a point-and-shoot camera and you know they're 40 yards away so you just see this tiny little black my first well my first yeah I don't even I think we got a few dorsal fin pictures we're standing on land I think at Lyme Kills cool to look back at that stuff like you know just as a photographer or just like as a you know whale lover like looking back at that stuff we just bought one of those disposable cameras and we saw a bunch of wind up my camera here yeah they're winding it up flash cube on top yeah my polaroid fell in the water a passenger was holding their laptop over the side vitamins like skyping or hard drive I have a photo of them doing it though because I was like there's a MacBook at the bottom of the monitor a submarine the Ventanas gonna come macbook one day was in our planet wasn't it oh maybe I don't remember there's like there's a picture of a chair and and the BBC yeah I wonder where this there is a lawn chair out at Davidson there's like a cargo ship container there too right yeah I remember them showing they did a talk over at someone who was researching the Davidson that did the talk over at Pacific Grove Natural History Museum and he also talked in science Sunday or whatever that is at Seymour ok did a report on it well we prevented a blanket from going to the bottom of the sea today so thanks good why was it floating like that I was weird slapping it was for like picnics yeah I didn't even touch it I just like they just threw it in the trash can but when you guys gonna cost can return it okay Carolyn has a great speaking of trash if you want to come clean the beach on Sunday oh yeah yeah although rewind and delete this part it even comes out I'm still I'm still sauceless later make up an excuse for him to leave hey Adam I heard that there's certain residents back outside across the street and look for probably at the beach would you actually can you go straight over to dude and that's why I'm screwed up for us your dream boy came out about today and you're usually on the boat so that's screwed it up as well oh my luck cannot get any better I can't do anything more it could get worse though bad weather bad water tomorrow Adam well we had awesome had an Adam had an awesome week of amazing encounters that's right yes and hopefully we all have tons more in 2019 I want a basket right here man passing sharks whoo yeah well they well they still be there when I get there if I come to Santa Barbara hopefully we'll basking sharks and leather bags yeah I need a leatherback this yeah I feel that embarrass me with that a year for first it is alright well next week yeah we want rebels here well that too but um yes yeah I went to why and so uh compacts there and then I went well sharks and touch agree well so those are all first I touched agree well your first man 2019 yeah at least for me someone captured that our days like Torian the earth but I also said 2019 should be the year that you find a alternate to balloons yes he said alternative party favors alternate party favor instead of balloons Oh Roger yeah Roger that yeah it's a lame that there's balloons just all the time dude it's like it's like plastic like people just use it people will always use it it's always use it better yes I always tell people instead of you know spending the five ducks on the five bucks on the balloon just give them the five bucks or a gift card yeah it's so worth it yeah who needs a balloon it's actually a glass Snapple cuz a lot more plastic it's always been glass now they're plastic don't lot of them are and when I walk in there Davi don't know if he knows but I was having them all like tapping every bottle to double-check hey there's beers in glass oh my god she's so young such a baby yeah well I'm a whale baby I could be your dad makes it sounds weird that's weird okay happy early birthday Adam thanks appreciate it yeah happy birthday well baby hope I'm on her party to eat you know the rare CA 122 super super rare spot in the world they're gonna be mega rare when I saw let's say one any night no one ever told me I saw a super rare train mega rare rare in the world I'm said oh that's how it works yeah hey guys thank you so much Adam for coming enjoyment was really fun podcast it was awesome to hear about your crazy week you had fun you were some of you guys were able to join it

voice is pretty this thing to Slater's voice is pretty yeah voice is pretty distinctive so say hi Caitlyn laughs you can hear me across the Pacific I'm so dang loud and now you can find Adam - yeah come down to Santa Barbara hey stop taking people away from Monterey captain Dave thank you all so much for listening if you don't if you found us some other way and you don't follow us follow us on Instagram it's at well nerds and yeah thanks for listening guys hope you all have a great rest of your week thanks for listening everyone bye

hello everyone and welcome back to the well Nerds podcast we are in episode 18 and I'm here with Caitlin and not Eric eric is not here because he's being mean and he's on a boat without us watching killer whales eat agree well I wouldn't necessarily say he's being mean but well we're salty because we prioritized the podcast now I'm just you know we just got unlucky and didn't get on the boat he's our my mom's in town and I went to lunch and I had to work today yeah but we have someone replacing Eric for this podcast and we have another special guest two weeks in a row now yeah our special guest is Eva and she likes whales yes and you are from I'm from England and what do you do exactly in England she was whale watching so I'm currently studying for a master's at the University of Cambridge and the British Antarctic Survey on on what would you say before the blue whales funny enough Oh funny enough we're gonna make a repeat like 10 things so you're studying blue whales yes and you told me that you get to cut their bones yeah so basically I go around museums so for example the Smithsonian up in DC and the Natural History Museum over in London and I take their bones and drill bone powder which allows me to extract and amplify their DNA and what kind of science you get out of that population dynamics and genetic diversity of the blue whales in the North Atlantic during a specific timeframe though right yeah so it's pre exploitation so mainly from the 1870s to the 1920s well you're looking at these bones that have been collected back then yeah Oh China population pre whaling right yeah and basically see how whaling is in pacted the blue whale population and if this is specifically caused an increase in hybridization with fin whales yeah I like trying to get back there like we need we're gonna do whatever we can to get some numbers and we need some more mates around fin whale over there I haven't seen a blue whale and weeks haven't seen bones from recent bones at Blue Hose and so I have seen recent bones as well but I'm predominantly focusing on the older ones for the thesis did the bones look stronger now or then or anything different like that some of the bones I found a really aerated so when I'm drilling them I'm not getting much bone powder out because there's so many air sockets within them and that's can be due to a number of things maybe how they're stored bacteria things like that mm-hm this is a science podcast but it's cool man think of all the dinosaur things we wanted to have you have right yes okay we're not here not here you have to come back maybe tomorrow maybe tomorrow that's true we were like last week we're seeing so many rednecks are the phalaropes hmm so I thought maybe we're gonna have some blue whale show up just cuz and we even saw a humpback lunch on krill so yeah and the water is fairly cool in the Bay right now like mid to low 50s so it's coming together I had some good upwelling wind last week which kept us off the water but you've been out I think since you've gotten here you've been out of the water almost every day almost every day apart from today yeah yeah did you go an afternoon yesterday yes yes did you get some lunch feeding you go yeah your day Friday yeah that was a few but they were like way far off you know it's so funny you guys today I went on the boat and we were watching like over 1225 easily and like but within the quarter mile and this whale kind of there were lunch feeding off and on and in this one whale kind of like lifted his head slapped it but very like not like high low water you saw the video you just lifted it up and it stopped it and then threw his tail up and I was like this whales gonna breach everybody watch 10 seconds later flies out of the water no and I can and then so like a few minutes later you know I'm like I got down low in the back and like oh I'll get like a lower shot and then I kind of nothing happened so then I walked it right as though but I was like whatever I had already gotten the first breed shot like today set like boom no and I could no one said anything about killer whales on the radio so I'm like pumped him go to lunch with my mom mark my wife and then like I don't even know where it was I was on my way home from somewhere and then I get a text it's like I'm watching a predation so I might be late to the podcast got worse oh yeah afternoon that was so weird yeah so we were like watching these humpbacks and Austin what does a head stand in the middle of the group and we're like it was it was like it went up like held for like five six seconds and then like slowly went back down yeah that's funny I saw well kind of kind of did that today where he's just like his tail was out for a few seconds and it kind of waved in and just like sunk in yeah this one was like completely vertical like mine was now that much but it was it was weird like you know how sometimes I swear whales like tease you so they're like socializing a little bit and they like kind of keep it interesting enough for you to stay and then like they do nothing for 10 minutes straight but sleep and you're like dude this sucks and then you go to leave and they do a tail throw and you're like well they're probably like we'll win the boat if you think about the boats just in neutral and they can probably feel like you're the vibration you have engines but then once you could put it in gear they're like oh they're what something's change like they're moving or they're leaving you know yeah like and then you stop and then they like go back to being normal but then you move again like I think they know that I tell people actually now on the microphone a lot more often than I used to is like if they've been intermittently doing behaviors I'm like okay we're leaving but honestly all of you go to the back and look because I bet it's gonna breach or tails throw or something but we're gonna go but if you want to see it go to the back and like 60% of the time they do it happened right at the end of our summer this summer I was I just I remember it was like we're leaving it was a sunset trip and my foot it was actually kind of far away I was like I feel feeling as well as gonna breach soon as we leave because it was just kind of active from near the boat and then it sure enough did it I feel like that happens like five out of it does happen quite often know when you're let's say more than half the time if a whale has been intermittently active it breaches when you leave yeah wonder why well there's a paper that came out a couple like two years ago now I think when groups former group separated humpback whales this is mostly from the breeding grounds that one whale will breach dude that's what I said so that's what I thought today that whale like all these whales lunch fit over off the right and this thing just like didn't lunch feed and then he kind of turned really quickly did his little head lifting and then fluked up real high and I think this thing just got kicked out of the feeding disabled you can't feed you can't see like he said we did the one breach then he breached I missed it and then right after that breach she did like tension slaps in her or like like six gents ops and around then he just solely like there were less and less and then he left - maybe I'll probably kick you probably got kicked out you're like you don't feed well like you weren't you weren't in the rhythm man you gotta go yeah I've seen great whales do that on migration - I think you've been out with me before we've seen like a group of five six whales come together and then like one gets kicked out and breaches and then leaves yeah we're like you're not our friend so you had an all day trip yeah even was on it and you got to see was super duper duper rare chance I know until the end of the trip for us to work out oh I think we heard one go yeah when we got home so I posted it yeah yeah cuz you know what okay I was at home when they were getting off the water cuz I had work in the office and you heard it they called me no you called me when you got off the boat and you were coming home and you're like we saw these whales that were really weird and you're like I don't know if they're Offshore's or what and I had seen your photos and I said no they're pretty big I think they are Chad we thought they were too big I was the way they were spread out in like a line formation that's why they were kind of but I was like there are transients but I don't recognize that male and then it turned out that their killer whales from British Columbia how awesome to sightings of whales from freaking up north in the hundred thousand miles yeah and they said it's the first time in thirty years had been seen which is well they've never I don't think they said they've never been seen yeah scene in Oregon British Columbia in Alaska yeah incredible I guess they're over forty years old yeah I mean they looked like that male looked like a big old yeah it was a big his fin was starting to ruffle in the back so he's old that was incredible unfortunately they were really traveling so we didn't spend like a whole lot of time but it was really amazing just to get to see them everybody a lot of people were first time seeing orcas on the boat and it dropped my anxiety level from like you know everybody's coming on this trip to see killer well yeah killer whale season yeah and the seasons been slow so I know you were sweating it yeah been like 14 days or something like that yeah so it's good checked out the we relaxed I was like okay we saw them you could go back to like something that's them you got to see what else did you see this week Rizzo's yeah you could shoot underwater better than you can see that more clean yeah yeah snorkeling great well and then we uh we saw humpbacks maybe like one or two lunches like sporadic and no one really saw it and then the breach that you called out she was sitting right next mean I thought someone like had died yeah so everybody will get got everybody back up ya know yeah cuz I guess I didn't see it cuz I was inside talking people cuz I just we just you know bear less harbor so like meeting everyone mm-hmm and then I didn't have my camera yet and I guess this is the cab the crowd was still kicking it was so cool did you see it rip the claws off for ya Harbor just popped up with it I stopped there ruthless yeah they're beggars I feel like the goals are really hormonal right now cuz they're setting up their nests cuz they have been like out of control on the wharf they were whacking the goals he did it a lot and then and then after he finished the fish he went to like kind of porpoise up out of the water he's a little jump and almost hit the albatross and yeah kind of puts the brakes on and like dodges but you can see him totally stick his like as it winds out far you know to like break yeah it was really funny so he almost hit the albatross he definitely whack some goals yeah but it hadn't I don't know I have to look at it yeah I don't know what type of rock on so if it was one yeah figure it out well okay so you got to see all the species you get to see humpbacks killer whales Rizzo's gray whales sea otters sea lions harbor seals we went to horses I saw a breaching hobby bulbous yeah so I think we talked about this on the podcast before but often times when we see breaching harbour porpoise it's a male after it's been mating so sometimes there's still a little bit of a display intense what happened I'm like no this is the cool thing here and then I get my camera ready to catch it again and it's so close to the bow of the boat my zooms too big and I'm just like you know what I was gonna enjoy it like I don't focus on this and this is all I'm trying to think of anything else you saw okay this is good to see an elephant seal with me when we were over here today so we walked by there okay but this is a prime example of spending more than two or three days in Monterey and going on and you only went on basically let's just say the morning trip for all in it yeah you know and you saw you know like five different things right and every trip was completely different I'm so different yeah so this is why you have to plan more than one day yes you don't have to even that one day can be special that's right two or three days if you have something specific on your list yes I do you see something you shouldn't just bag on okay I'm gonna go on this whale watch I'm gonna see it and then go do something else you need to yeah especially because you got here right when the weather was coming back down and cuz like the day before you know I was stressed some not happy people on the boat let's just say yeah dude I have another trip I'm a eighth and like in the weather I keeps every day every day you get a new like every day you get like that one day further and they're like weather like forecast and so like it's on like May 4th right now that I can see up until it's like flat calm all this week until May 4th and I'm like oh no it's just got a trip watch out fine we're going we're going we'll find them whales yeah dude I told you about the harbor seal walking up to the elephant seal oh the baby one yeah I was like I'm not your mom yeah there was that core there was a little baby every like on his back I could his flippers up and like just like laying there like I don't know rolling around I like when they get rolled in their waves especially when they're coming in for the swim lessons the moment got out the water and the baby's trying to catch up but couldn't get out we had one trying to climb on a rock and it was like trying to get up and it was like doing these like motions and then it kind of like just fell back again and then then I look like the mom pretty much just grabbed yeah hold it away because it couldn't get on it the other morning actually I was standing outside of the office at the wharf and a mom and pop were just hanging out underneath the pier just looking around swimming around it was no it wasn't a very big puff like it was probably one that was born on the other side of the wharf between like on the REC trail you know how there's that little rubbery over there I think it was one of those pups and it was just like you know how they draft off the mom's back and they're like just basically on top of her while they're swimming it was so cute she's like and this is where they get rockfish with the baby and it was honestly the cutest thing is right by the boat and oh my goodness nice it was so sweet but I think by this point all the passengers weren't even looking because they were like I need to get back to dry land yeah the other way everybody's alright yeah the drea means been kicking in for several hours or they were sick and yeah yeah they're done I don't want to do the sea lions at the end of the trip there so we can get out there like right away yeah it kind of yeah can depends captain or either way yeah mm-hmm yeah Friday so my day out on the water was pretty good in the mornings later actually got some really good drone footage from the morning trip oh the belly video yeah just to please yeah the whale like lunch feeds and like flips over upside down but isn't it cool other waters at the end it's not the stomach but it's like the end of it like the throat please you can see the rippling of the motion of the whale stopping you want to call it like its belly but it's because of the way you can see the undulation like that's the whale slowing down and then the water and the throat is catching up and then it yeah it's really cool for the like thing I can do that that's how they do it on the BBC oops [Laughter] you put that in GarageBand and just edit it up a little bit but yeah that was good and you know what um I at one point I don't know if you heard me say it during the trip I was like was that a gray whale wandering through the feeding humpbacks I think we saw I was near like another boat somewhere right yes so then Eric was on blue ocean and we were out with discovery and he actually got a photo of it and I was like I thought I saw one cuz we were right next to each other and today Danny on the boat said he saw a great whale feeding with Tom back yeah I coming yes you think that's not humpback yeah well a couple a couple days in a row now yeah yeah Eric said that to me a couple days ago I said you know I think there's a great whale in there trying to eat anchovies and and the reports actually of the gray whales this season has been really bad you know there's a lot of skinny whales there wasn't very many whales in the lagoons and now we were up to like 30 mortalities on the northbound my group of killer whales well yeah and then there's that too but also just adult whales are dying you know on the northbound migration and then actually to me it's not terribly surprising because Jim sue Mitch actually kind of suspected something like this would happen so after the late 90s El Nino the early 2000s there was a pretty big die-off on the preceding or the following two northbound migrations because the whales basically like ran out of gas and so I think that's what's happening now is like we had that warm water blob and that weird El Nino thing in 2013 to 2015 and now it's like all catching up with them they didn't forage very well the last few years and now they're kind of running out of steam as they head north again so we'll see what happens but it's definitely been slow year for gray whales and it's been a slow year for killer whales because of that as well I think not as many births so I hope was just a later because they definitely later it was a whole like the the beginning portion of the migration was late too so great yeah and then yeah I mean we had and it was so may it's gonna be awesome the peak on this outbound migration was like right at the end of January where's the last few years had been more in the middle and then it was all at once it was like all the sudden like hundred well today we're going by Monterey and I was like whoa happen this year was like fifty plus a trip yes yeah but only for like four days right I mean I knew like it was an hour honestly yeah it was crazy fifty fifty whales now are no problem like then like the ACS January trip is only two hours and we still saw over fifty whales in two hours pretty impressive yeah so on the boat you're telling me that you've been to Iceland yes and we're LCG whales have been to Australia iceland off the coast of Europe so in Spain Italy I've been on a cruise around the Canaries and the sauce which was awesome and working as a wildlife officer and then I've been also off the coast of Canada so Nova Scotia where oh yeah yeah Ireland and then I've been on the west coast as well so just north of Vancouver Island volunteer thing with Cape Anne out of Massachusetts to sort of maybe whale watching out there yes I've been watching Massachusetts four five five years I think it's four or five years now oh my god like every summer I know everywhere for whales I thought I was cool she's living the high life really yeah but she doesn't live in a place where you can see whales so I guess you have to decide my son ever well was a minke well I'll never forget it it was in the Outer Hebrides in Scotland and it was really a stinky minky it's one of those ones I smelt it and then I saw it and I was like oh my goodness thank you you really uh really must love whales if minke whale got you captured you said you went we're watching Italy where was it was it's over the G um it was a what in the jabal straight no they're like Juno Geneva's and some I forget there's a place that I was looking on Instagram and then they see like pilot whales or something yeah there's um tomorrow's is I think yes pretty sure that's more off the coast of Spain though because they definitely go out of Spain and they're so close to each other you're just sharing the sea through there anyway yeah yeah a lot of pilot whales they see a lot of orca actually too lots of it's more dolphin species than whales there I was doing fin whale research off the coast of Barcelona mm-hmm which was pretty awesome and that was Mothercraft pairings hmm but yeah more so done deceits mediterranean - yeah harbour porpoises is the main one and bottlenose dolphins pretty common yeah sometimes you see the common dolphins and then whale wise it's min keys and the occasional humpback this year in particularly we've had a lot more humpback we have you know they actually started well watching out of cork and Ireland like more regularly the last five years - because they've been seeing more whales there someone writes me on Facebook I forget her name right now but she always lets me know when they do have humpbacks show up and it sounds like they're seeing him more and more yeah I mean when I was so I went to Ireland in 2013 and it wasn't really thing there cuz I looked cuz I was like I was almost done with school and I was like you know I want to well start watching whales anywhere I go on vacation and there wasn't really anything and then literally the next year they were like all these humpback whales and fin whales off of Cork Ireland and I was like taking it off the east coast of Scotland now cuz I've got the resident bottlenose dolphin population I've actually been adopting one of their bottom noses my mom got it for me for my fifth birthday oh my god name is rainbow and I still a doctor and I keep getting the the adoption certificates like congratulations you have now reached 15 years of adoption it just keeps going up to like 1617 I'm like oh my goodness and that was really like what do you want for your birthday when I was five I want a dolphin I've never been to sea funghi yes oh my goodness so this was all I wanted to do when my parents are like where do you want to go on holiday what do you want to do I want to go see funky what is that funky is the most famous bottlenose dolphin in Ireland is he still there yes yeah like a super old singular no pod but on those so when the people swim with her something yeah they used to yeah they say he's like crankier in his old age and he's not like right up by the harbor but there's lots of photos of people when he was young he they would like jump off the docks and swim with him so it was it was our first like proper trip and we went to go see funghi because this is all I wanted to do I think I was maybe six years old my brother was four and they've got this copper sculpture just on the harbor with this statue funghi we go out on the boat three times turns out everyone in my family is ridiculously seasick my poor dad is throwing up everywhere that which makes them my brother like really upset because obviously he's young and that my mum's just like not feeling good and I'm just there like where it's fine three days nothing no I was just I didn't matter I didn't know when we went to Dingle we heard about it but we didn't there was no really any boat tour so we didn't go yeah yeah yeah the Facebook page I follow it you loves the boat sometimes you're like breaches right in the wake right next to the boat there's one I think one of the most famous images he's coming right out of the water and you can literally like see a person next to it yeah and you can just see the size comparison funghi is huge ya know there's this one guy that goes out in a cell but all the time in funky like loves him so there's always these photos of him in this guy Dingle dolphin in Ireland bucket list of everything is to go to Ireland and see funky yeah like rose velvet like totally 90s out of those like ice pops which is lots of little ice balls in my hand with the biggest smile on the screen like Emeril that was like so it's just one where's this product this is just one hey this one has a come up multiple right here so time's other dolphins will come into the bay that he lives in and interact with for a little while but Funky's yeah quite territorial yeah he just stays by himself in the bay after they leave crusty old man now that's funny how old do you think is like forty or fifty years old he's definitely older than I am yeah he's definitely older than thirty based on the stories I heard when we were there that's awesome still still never seen him one day one day it will happen well I want to go we're watching in Ireland well when you were over there like yeah let's go that is in my neck of the woods oh my goodness okay say for well watching no but I am going to China in August teach environmental sustainability to kids in a summer camp which is pretty awesome and then come September my masters will be done I'm free as a bird and hopefully I'll be working on either whale watching boats or cruise ships so that's the plan naturalizing and photographing malta science communication you know so you're out on deck I mean I've done it before I did it around the Canaries and the Azores and it was awesome because you've just got a really engaged group of people and you chat to them about what you're seeing while you're seeing it what they're doing and then if they want you know over dinner you just talk about it more and it's a really good platform to get your message across and get them to make you know those small differences that make a big difference literally [Laughter] well I can't give you a too many my secrets but so far we're looking amplifying all the DNA so while I'm here it's actually been sent off for sequencing so when I get back on Monday I'm gonna have all of their basically genomes to look through and I'm looking at the control region so I basically take all of my samples line them all up and I'm using different primers to see where they're binding and looking for mutations in different individual strands to basically see the difference in genetic diversity between the Western population the eastern population in the central population and see basically the difference is because at the moment it's said that there's four subspecies then there's further subdivision based on citation management and things like that so it's basically seeing how far of that much of that is accurate and reliable how much of its changed over time yeah because not a lot of genetic work has been done particularly in the North Atlantic on Blee wells because obviously there's so much data missing from certain areas or certain regions or the data what I'm finding at the moment is a lot of it's really degra gated so it's really hard to actually amplify the DNA from because there's the bones are in such poor shape that we're not getting much from it which is a shame but we're working at the minute and designing my own primers to basically try and get longer strands for the control region so we can do some comparison work because it'd be such a shame not to be able to use all the samples her own version of what she thinks the DNA needs to be almost a complete strand so that she can get all the information she can out of each sample so oftentimes if it's a well known species they have the primers kind of like preset they're like oh yeah definitely put it in this the blue whales so basically we found a lot of the primers from the literature aren't working on my samples which is obviously a real shame but they're also historic samples and all of the ones in the literature for modern samples so again it's the degradation over time but what is really important is you need to be able to amplify a region that previous papers have also amplified so then you can compare because if you're amplifying your own region which nobody else has ever amplified before air you probably amplifying the wrong region for genetic analysis because there's such slow like mutation rate for blue whales because they're so large compared to something like a map Mouse or like a rabbit or something like that exactly so the rate of mutation is much slower and the genetic turnover is much slower but if you're come so you need something that you can make compare but you need to make them so you compare them to other peoples work otherwise I like that I'm making my own DNA cocktail yes that's not farther spread out Wow found out but then we already know that the ones in the southern hemisphere like smaller well they could so it could all be one population in the Atlantic so you're saying like this is all like common dolphin like short big long weak being or now no it'd be more like paying you know so it'd be like the different humpback whale populations oh yeah yeah or like different breeding groups yeah so now different eco types and blue whales is different probably subspecies or ecotypes but blue meaning that they feel different when you start talking about yeah slightly different for example like the killer whale or the Orca ecotypes where you've got the type a the type either type c this.type d it's slightly different to that because obviously they're trying well they're currently working out if the type D is actually a new or separate species well yeah well I mean like I'm obviously I don't think anyone here seen them eat a dolphin like in Newport Beach when we see it then when they've seen them we oh it's always white sea bass or yellowtail or other like fish and in Hawaii I think it's why in the first opening scene of our planet it's false killer whales chasing spinner dolphins decide now our planet is awesome I'm pretty sure when they in the ocean episode there's like two ocean episodes polar bear stop there was definitely an artic maybe they said their fear they were kicking penguins yeah yeah yeah okay we talked about and you were there as well the ACS meaning [Music] the author of polka work how we came to know and love this apex predator yes got it six times over whoops miss yeah so that was interesting Jason Colby spoke at the Monterey Bay ACS meeting at the end of April and I feel like he summoned these Washington and BC whales because they both came like there was two sightings before his I feel like the day before so the book is Orca how we came to know and love the oceans greatest predator the history of killer whales and I like that it's not like the science it's like more like just the history of what how humans thought of them yeah it's really cool yeah so crazy stuff so I got to go out to dinner with Jason cuz I'm on the board for yes Monterey so we take this because to dinner before they speak and he's like a maritime history guy so he looks at how humans interpret like fishing and well watching and nature basically he's at the University of Victoria British Columbia and so that's what he was writing in his book on and he's actually about to start another book about grey whales so he's gonna be back in Monterey again to do research for his next book about how humans have interacted with grey whales over history so that's gonna be pretty cool but yeah I like his perspective looking back at the history of like you know first we were terrified of them and then we tried to kill them and then maybe there were our friends and then they were a money-making opportunity and now it's like it's tended to an industry basically there's supers of what you're saying about the gray Wells because he's gonna be back and forth between Monterey Bay and obviously his home he's saying a lot of his times gonna be spent interviewing people and getting like the people's perspective and the history of that side of things as opposed to obviously going out on the boat every day to see degree well it was really interesting to see like the pop culture little moments for killer whales newspaper articles like that one hundreds of seals and attacked a lighthouse skiff you know some of those headlines he showed us where absolutely crazy they just shot them with machine guns yeah they were especially in the Antarctic but anywhere they were trapping fur seals really they were like all these killer whales are eating all our food you know eating all our furs and so we're gonna kill them too my favorite story was the guy that like put his feet in the water breaks his feet and it was the killer whale that was being kind of ornery that day so he just like sat there the trainer sat there and like put his feet in the water it was like trying to he was like a girl yeah the killer was not responding to his test anyway he liked it like did it perfectly ten times in a row is there a percentage right that's time you went back to do it yeah and so then he put his feet in the water and she scraped his feet with her teeth and then she went around the tank seriously 11 times and then on the twelfth time he left his feet in the water after she scraped because he like reacted every time and after she scraped his feet the twelfth time left his feet in the water and she like make some kind of like vocalization towards him and looked at him and left him alone and he was like I have become the test subject she is with some the teacher their intelligence is underrated yes majorly so so he talked about a million of something and I said how many people don't see a million of any animal and we were saying the only thing that we can think of that you would see a million of is maybe birds very inland and if you're not into wildlife you may not see a million of a single species in your whole life easily I'm sure I've seen over a million City shirt waters but I'm super into one sitting by the way winces but in a few you know in my lifetime right jellyfish last yeah like in 2019 there are people that are gonna go their whole life without seeing a million of anything yeah I mean even you could live your whole life without seeing a million pigeons maybe not in England when they had it I forget where they had it at first like aquarium place yeah did a pin out front you know and the bits on the bay what was doing the long cause and then they finally heard another killer will respond like two miles away at like under some bridge or like you know and then somewhere this and yeah so I guess they moved the pin somewhere else - where would be like more just in a better a different area and then I guess the killer will sever the killer I'll shut up yeah it's so heartbreaking yeah I think it'd be so amazing I mean if they can let go of Lolita and just introduce they said the same words alive they said the same about Lolita though for the first X number of years I don't remember how many it was she would call for hours on end and wait for responses that never happened I just really think like for the last couple years can me you know give her a shot with her pie I think that'd be so cool yeah I think they would look cooler if they did that you don't I mean yeah like that might maybe help them out a little bit yeah how cool would it be if they because I think what they think she's part of l-pod been saying yeah perspective longest 64 something are born in 64 the Orca that's been kept in captivity for the longest period of time yeah dead fish I know it's frozen and then thawed salmon's where is that one oh the one with the missing yeah no but that's PEC fins and pretty sure it's in Norway yeah and now the ice read an article I'm not even kidding you a few weeks ago saying that Orca is now the matriarch and is now leading the pod and it's because the other members of the pod would catch the food and then bring it to the quote disabled Orca because it had no PEC fins and it's now thriving like it's not only survived being a calf and you know early child years but is it's thriving because they're so sentient as well they're these bonds you know just incomprehensible in some in some factors talking of O'Quinn know though I went last year with two of my really good friends from Iceland that I met while I was working over there and then to my Norwegian friends we went to go see the whales because it's it was peak time and is actually when Jody was there too and we went on quite a few different whale watches nothing and it's because the herring was it's such low capacity there like none of the whales have come into the region and Jody just saw them because she went quite a few hours further north than I was I think it was five or six five hours further north driving and she only saw a few and that was supposed to be their you know prime time and no else not even you know idle Wells no else I'm saying it's getting later and later and later that they're arriving so we went I think it was the second or third week of either November or December anyway it was supposed to be prime time they're supposed to you know have been there already and settled in but no no not nothing they got me wrong as a great trip but it was a wellness trip you go around the world to see whales and sometimes you don't see them yeah we are so lucky here I mean our hop backs are back in like big numbers already that was pretty early I've seen so many humpbacks this week or was it like his last neighbor I kind of hundred twenty four consistently on a whale watch you seem like 25 consistently like 10 miles for monsters like probably 30 whales in that area yeah and even when you're watching wells you just see blows literally 360 degrees around the boat in the distance there was some ding dog the well we're not gonna get hurt but the two guys they're gonna get it's what we saw yesterday afternoon this little tiny boat with two people on it if it two seconds earlier and they would have collided like she went over exactly where the whale had just flute and there's three of the whales too so I mean one of their flippers is a time you know around them yeah must be a lot of fish there caffeic we picked up a lot of blooms of the day huh yeah we did a lot of bling on the old day I think we picked up four and as a side note we picked up a note balloon with an O on it and it was to a loved one and it's like there are so many ways that you can show your respects rather than writing a note on a balloon and releasing it because it ends up in the ocean and then you're just caught causing further damage because they do them as tributes and then they let go of them being like it was company used to do it where was it it was somewhere in America that they let go a million of let go of million balloons for the news it was something crazy like six years later these balloons because they were all low bowed and branded we're still washing up and some of them got as far as England you know like yeah the awesome blue planet planet yeah yeah there's a book about it too though and then also there was a very famous spell of a bunch of Nike shoes and they tracked where all the Nike shoes of that specific make and model washed up what's amazing is literally be like to know each other and then they split off into different currents you know and then end up in different countries on different continents it's crazy I mean there's and there's all sort of thing more about that there's wildlife that distributes around the ocean like that - like the leatherback sea turtle right the ones we see in Monterey come from Indonesia and whatever current is prevalent when they hit the beach that's where they end up and that's where they return on their migration as adults they lay down like a chemical signature of that of that current and then that's where they navigate for the next for the rest of their life turtles are crazy dude they're like magic yeah is their thing is weird like the whole like going straight back to where he came I saw a picture last week I can't remember where it was but the beach that this turtle obviously it was its breeding Beach it's where it kept going back every year he'd been industrialized oh yeah and there's a blitz yeah and it was a picture of this toe obviously ready like about to pop with eggs on an on a London trip because that's yeah because that's what it's you know home beach it turned into immediately blow away from each other so you only have all the ones on the same axis in the same place after they've bloomed and like they just ride the currents in the waves wherever they end up sometimes you see literally millions of them all in the same place because the wind carry them all they're these kind of things I mean we just don't even we have no idea what kind of impact we're making on it crazy so you going back home tomorrow yes I've got the entire day in LA so I may go up to Newport or down to Newport and do some we're watching out of there and then I fly out I think it's quarter past midnight Monday morning so it's gonna be a big yeah you guys don't tell the time like I told of time look to me like I was crazy like like like quarter to nine is 8:45 well I thought normally say quarters tonight but I mean I think at this point it was like 8:30 so like Rita courts two outside like they gotta make some assumptions clearly I was just well yeah that's my masters my masters is genetics um blue whales my undergrad was harbour porpoise and might be dolphin acoustics that was in Iceland and then yeah like I said next steps is up and coming to be determined come September see yeah it's exciting yeah so I'm hoping to basically naturalize and take photos and just love life on on the water instead of you know behind a lab drilling and doing tests with the pets yeah you should see my jeans oh my goodness that covet in wild ena oh my jeans yeah well my jeans are well jeans in a all intermingled yeah right oh I'm jealous already so I don't want to hear his photo so far oh my goodness stop we get it ok look out cuz we're mad and let him go I'm really hoping that they're feeding on tomorrow yeah fingers crossed for you guys since it's like the first one maybe other ones will come in first one in the bay well you know reporter of killer whales are talking agree well in Morro Bay today as well so two two predictions within like two hundred miles of each other that is awesome now you have to now there's no choice alright thank you guys so much for listening if you guys don't follow us on Instagram its well nerds and if you guys have any questions or comments feel free to send us a DM or just leave us a comment one of the photos one of these days will get back to all the questions but we've had way too many exciting well reports and some special guest lately but keep sending us the questions we are getting them and we're happy to answer them during the podcast when when you get time may not be for a few weeks after what's going on today already it's been really good if you can thank you all for listening bye bye

hello everyone and welcome back to the well nerds podcast this is episode number 19 and I have Eric and Caitlyn here with me hey everyone hello welcome back Eric back was a long predation on we don't want to hear what you have to talk about okay later doesn't want to hear but I don't wanna hear about it I want to hear you wanna hear about okay so what day was it was a few days ago yeah Sunday oh that's no Saturday yeah was Saturday so I was on an all day trip I was hoping to be back around you know 4:30 or 5:00 or so so I could meet up with the rest of the well nerds here but it ended up being that I had to stay a little bit longer out at sea because yeah you know a little gray well cab was like please stay I don't think it asked that so anyway I was with the rest of the gang there in all day well watched trip out of the blue ocean whale watching the high spirits and towards the end of the day yeah we came upon some killer whales at 51 days with 50 B so that was five whales yeah and they were zigzagging this exacting so it was kinda cool we saw him but then they just kept things exact answer like oh well we'll let them be so we went off go to took a look at some breaching humpbacks and then we look back towards the killer whales we weren't too far from maybe about half mile and we know it's a lot of splashing so captain Kate you know went over there next thing you know there is a predation event going on it was a boat no other boats were over there 300 boats were over there but they were kind of quiet I think we were excited if are really active humpbacks so we did really pay attention but eventually no splashing over there went over there and turned out it was a predation event pretty dramatic it actually lasted four hours plus we didn't see the actual calf take its last breath less blow but did you guys are out till dark right yeah almost yeah almost had to be back by yeah seven you sent us a message at Lake yeah one or two they came in writing they're like twelve hour mark yeah so we had to you know get in there because we had one captain so but yeah the last of the Wow that calf I mean it sounds kind of bad you're like you know just end but it could it would just came up and flow to the surface and I was still breathing and we watched most of the pod actually chase off the mom and then they all five turn back Oh interesting yeah all five turn back and you know went to go finish off the calf and I want to say we were about five miles off of outside-of-the-box Landing Harbor and eventually towards the end of it we were about three miles away from so it was actually coming closer to shore and yeah mom and baby fought their hardest to you know go for the shallows but you know it's one of those events yes it's sad but it's I always mention how you're gonna learn things by watching predations you won't read in books you can see that plotting the strategies and stuff like that I don't think I've ever seen a predation where they chased off the mom successfully and then just had the calf to themselves I've seen the mom leave right afterwards and I've seen them drown the calf right in front of the mom but I've never seen him actually push the mom we always talked about that one to happen in front of cannery row that one they tried I remember that one that the two bigger males kept I'm trying to push mom away yeah but yeah she still was right there and then she started charging the boats and charging the killer whales after the cast the mom mom thought fought really hard I mean this was one of those ones that everything was pretty clear you know so yeah if you guys want to I think all of our listeners are followers anyway yeah we have a few photos up yes graphic but you do every single person that video was like oh we watched that and we saw that predation the other day yeah like so many people had seen what you guys it was live for like it was brought everybody was going live with that predation yeah yeah but you know typical predation where mom held the calf on her back as long as possible and you know watching them repeatedly you know tried to knock the calf off and then pulling at the PEC fins to pull her down even at the flukes eventually at one point it looks even more dramatic than the cuz they picture you have the calf's mouth is open yeah so it looks like it yeah pretty intense yeah it's pretty intense you know we all obviously love animals but you know we all gotta understand that these are our California transients and that's one of their favorite meals but so far this year when we had Slater sea lions California yeah yeah but you know interestingly enough there was a report from Morro Bay whale watch of a predation at about eleven a day yeah that's pretty crazy I was wondering what pot that was did you look at the footage I couldn't really tell from the footage you didn't watch very closely cuz there's just one Facebook video you could be yeah I don't know we haven't seen her in it Wow yeah but it was interesting I don't think I've ever heard a report of two happening so close together on the same day like distance-wise yeah exactly that's not fascinating yeah we're starting to get some more encounters with killer whales yeah season gets further you had the CA 51 A's and 50 B that day mm-hmm and then the next day we saw them again yeah and then everybody kind of left them and then lost them for the afternoon and then I think we had nothing yesterday yeah and now we have the CA 51 a is again today and you guys really just left them and I just left them purely just left yeah yeah 51 51 CA 51 and then see if if they want a z' and 50 b yeah there was nine killer whales you know in the 51 days one of those adult whales is 49 see also do you have family lines in there okay 49 see she yeah I think it's a female just with a really tall fin and she travels with 51 a and her two kids so she's not actually one it interesting it's funny because when I first pulled up to him I was like I saw a Ryan bumper and then 40 or 50 B but then I was like oh there maybe there's another sprouter in there yeah I think that's 49 C and I think it is female mm-hmm you feel like it's been enough years that if it didn't have a full on like male fin at this point it's definitely just a female that pointy fin is are getting routing to like 10 or 11 yeah but yeah I don't has looked like that the whole five years I've been here yeah I mean dude comment is I don't know yeah comment as combat doesn't grow quick scenery change colors you know she I've seen her when she was still little yellow Catholic she's still so rinky-dink compared to everyone else in there I mean there there's got some big old adult whales in their group you know some very healthy robust adults we uh during the encounter day we first pulled up on them they were just kind of traveling mm-hmm and they weren't moving very fast and then they kind of just stopped and then they came actually right next to the bow and then I started circling really fastly like really fast and you know how they come out like at an angle you mean like the door yeah so it looked like they were chasing it looked like they had like found something I was like oh sweet it's gonna be organized some action and then they kind of stopped and there was just a couple albatross flying around and then like three or four more sequences go by then the goals and everything and then you start we started smelling blubber yeah oh man it was like strong spine and I was like I haven't smelled this in a while mm-hmm I'm just wondering if it's possibly Saturday's kill or fresh one overnight or last few days I don't know I don't think it was I mean we never saw anything come to the surface yeah suppose I mean one of the boats on the radio said that their deckhand had saw something in the mouth so I don't know what it was should have been a big harbor seal or an elephant seal yeah it definitely smells strong but also the wind is blowing this way so hmm so we're definitely starting to see some killer whales it's another year where we've got fifty ones around a lot lasts two seasons the 140s were the predominant pod during the grey whale attacks but back going back to the fifty ones that's fine whoever it was they spy out twice a day so yeah yeah you know actually the first underwater footage ever filmed was that whole group with 50 when she was still alive so on ten whales they'd killed an elephant seal and that was like they brought it over to the boat and I had the GoPro in the water you ever seen an elephant to like start to finish mm-hmm yeah a couple times owners usually they fall I feel like I've been on a kid was an elephants you know but by that time I was like you know just a round blubber and the fall in the summer is when I've seen elephant seals start to finish maybe three or four times November yeah I had one in July - it was like a young elephant seal I Ryan the elephant seal was right next to the boat looking at us with those pleading huge eye and all Ryan just like nailed it right next to those like Wonder so this might be a good kind of I think we could probably talk a lot about I always get questions about the strategies and the elephant seals like especially when they're up top recuperator literally looking straight up I wonder if that makes him a really easy target yeah just pick them off the surface because they're always like recuperating from that long dive and they see them they're always looking like yes I have that body's up to it's just asking for it yeah I don't know I mean I I couldn't say that I've seen that elephant seal resting and then the killer whales get on it but I'll see the killer whale stop and then an elephant seals head will come up yeah and you're thinking of you know an alert elephant seal it could easily just literally out dive them and you know obviously the breath holds a lot better than that but I swim faster than them on the way down that's true that part I don't know but I do know they can out dive them and that is a method of escape yeah good way to escape eh I wonder how many of them do get away I'm probably going to tap them on the tail then they take off sometimes you know like if they're at forging like if it elephant chills you know mid water somewhere and they see it yeah like in the canyon yeah that could be another thing they could be getting them on the ascent like if they happen to go by and they click on an elephant seal that's coming up that was it it's already on the weakest part of its dive I wonder if elephant seals think about that stuff and then they always keep a little chamber of oxygen I don't know I feel like Dan Casas lab would probably have a good handle on that they've done so much data collection on those elephant seals night yeah be cool to see how much oxygen they have left when they are coming to the surface if they're like Oh like that first breath yeah that's one yeah we haven't seen start to finish I know sealions we've seen start to finish literally recently yeah with the 5150 ones me and Slater saw that just what weeks ago about a month now and those seems like it's more it's almost like attack from the bottom and just chase right what's over the fifty ones taking forever to kill things they're still letting comet train I guess I don't know okay you guys are always like they're training it's like how many years well maybe they just want to play with their food yes I think that whales got a nautical seal and by now they kill him every day yeah but anyways your if your thing took four hours at 51 a so maybe they were just taught to eat slow yeah that's a pretty long attack four hours yeah did you ever see the fifty ones the 5151 a was there what do you mean before she broke off no no she had already had two kids on her own by the time I got here what if anyone has seen that yeah actually she's in blue planet the original one no no Ryan are in it with their mom and really fifty yet yeah I'm comment and bumper and I'm born yet I'd like to see the pod one before yeah just go back to that like that scene and blue planet from she's had star I don't know if she's lost in each may have lost one yeah I have only started seeing them since 2011 so I don't know anything before that yeah she's a pretty successful mom but 50 on the other hand I guess had a lot of kids and only 50 beasts arrived interesante so I don't know I mean that's they were still they were some of those whales were born when DDT was still really concentrated in Southern California that plant she's old she's gotta be like almost 40 she's pretty old she has to be she has to be around the 40s I think there's a guesstimate that bumpers probably in his mid-20s or so people are saying which means Orion in 51 a know what your name is are even older because he's the third kid there's a Ryan older than 51 eh no I think she was she's first because she's a and he's be okay Wow he's got some old whales out there no a little no above them dorsal for more information yeah I just like I just gave me an idea we'll talk about when we turn up these might yeah well so the action is warming up around the bay that's good and though yeah humpbacks are going off so today on our way out the hub acts are being kind of like there's tons of humpback spoilers so many of reaching everywhere in the distance I go over and then JJ was like it's kind of like killer whale I was like I've been saying that every day we're gonna see killer whales today wishful thinking then it's like you're right see like 10 like 10 or 15 minutes later after suppose when pecks lap and breaching bill call down the radio you think I got some killer whales here and date as I see I knew it that's really good some days it's like yeah you're like whale senses are tingling you're like something funny's going on the humpbacks have been great really we've all been getting really active ones and it's like good all outside it's like almost summer again we were starting to see the sea lions you know feed with them so things are looking good yeah maybe they're starting maybe they're like all celebrating that they're back in feeding grounds and they're like because they've been breaching quite a bit the last couple days yeah I might also be agitated from the killer whales being around true they do get pretty flustered about that I don't know you guys had killer whales intervene talk about that yeah it was really came in for a minute it wasn't that entertaining as like what mean you had last year so obvious but yeah during that predation event you know it was great it's one of those days where you had everything around you could just like stop the boat for the last you know few hours of the trip we're amongst all those salmon boats again and they're everyone's after anchovies you know the salmon and the humpback whales and the predation happened and you see humpbacks in the in the distance and then towards the end of it sometime started getting a little bit closer and closer or anything though no tail throws but they did trumpet blow but I do you have a few shots of them kind I wish I yeah I wish I could show our listeners but yeah we had you know one humpback just kind of falling around circling around the Orca they'll go right in the middle of them I've seen it multiple times now so in Eric's photo which maybe we can share later on Instagram or something there's a humpback following a killer whale in the same frame they're not there may be one body length apart yeah but the saw trumpet blows and I have I want to say last year we had a few instances where it got a little bit more obvious like you we had tail throws and stuff like that and I've seen also predation and a few years ago also back out there on Kate's boat where yeah they were it's always like - so it's not just like one humpback that comes in get in there as a juvenile and the juvenile killer whales had a field day with it I have some footage of them underwater yeah the juvenile killer whales were like zipping right by and like making noise obviously last year's me dude the one that means later so it was just crazy like they were like just circling this the sea line that was pretty much dead and it's buddy you're saying multiple times even four to save a bird the humpback came in yeah I think I think they're like get out of here Neighborhood Watch like you go away you're bothering my friends I'm you see them like fight a little bit comment breach on top of the humpback there was a humpback like really in the mix she's she's young and dumb she doesn't yeah no but her you know her and bumper went off together and they were just agitating this humpback because there was two or three in there that were trying to kick him out of the area and they had just killed like a harbor seal I don't think in car looks like breach like oh and I think as more as you know over the years watching all these predation events one tactic I've know this is this it's almost like they do a quick hit and then take off because they know that this whale gets a full yeah yeah it's gonna be yeah or Peck fan-dude yeah oh yeah yeah it's amazing how heavy those Peck friends really are I'm surprised that they don't get I'm surprised the killer whales don't have scars all over that exactly you're that good that you don't get hit by anything think about it they should have like barnacles scars on them from even the great way well they do but they're their skin heals almost exacts their scar tissues almost exact same color as their skin yeah you figure yeah I mean I think even you have a few photos that shows like how scratched up they can be it's just that their skin stays dark yeah yeah shoot because I have like rake marks from other killer wasn't on that dorsal fin of other killer whales yeah it's just stays black ya know yeah Charlie and some killer whales have really gnarly raked up saddles that are older like George has a very scratched up saddle path yeah and maybe the eyepatch is too or something can you yeah bumper had black streaks and his eye patch and it healed back white liners got that permanent one oh yeah he's a comment have one too comet just has this street yeah that streak right the eye patch but no black mark but yeah wonder why liners is permanent might be a pigment issue yeah maybe because you know how they get like freckles on their chin too yeah should make it equal I wanna have a day where yeah okay where we have the 5151 a's Emmas pod I don't know one of all to come just one or couple ooza it's happened like 40 transients hangout it's happened before and it'll happen again we got away for this gray whale situation to resolve itself need the ocean go back to normal temperatures so they start reproducing had a high rate again yeah san Francisco's count now of strandings is what it's nine Cisco pretty sad don't you drive up there and go poke at great dead gray whales yeah no I don't we gotta tell the other yeah don't don't touch too much cuz that smell stays on you yeah well oil that's a scent you can't get out of it I think I still smell like dead blue whale probably do we don't we don't get that close we don't want to know that's all right we want the killer whales to come around I'll show you I saw a cool thing that was not whales the other day that nobody else saw this Welner in game oh wait oh you didn't see it I saw a cell invasion in the harbor like two hours later the Beatles looked like a bull of fun it was crazy we were up it like it was like 4:45 in the morning he was sending off one of the fishing boats and their deckhand comes up he's like hey hey you got to see this and I was like dude I'm trying to check people in like no he's like the shops empty you have to come see this come quick and I was like okay so I went down the stairs he was like what is this was like the most South chains I've ever seen them oh yeah that's the most I've ever seen so what happened was two things one the current was slowly pushing them back further and further in the harbor towards the beach but also a bunch of small boats were going in and out of the harbor and some of the party but you were starting to go so there was like breaking them all up because when they're in change that's like they freshly cloned and then when they break off the chain they become the singular organism again and they can start cloning again interesting yeah but they're a whole bunch of different sizes so I think they might have been different species too is kind of weird yeah I don't know some saps got so big or suppose it's helps you guys are we gonna like have those instead of like so you know they're here it's just I've never seen him in the harbor like that before yeah I've never even seen him that concentrated out in the bay before I've seen big patches of them but not like girls eat them where they were all massacred yeah lot of things I guess the rockfish had been eating them because the fisherman said they're in their stomachs mm-hmm in case you don't I know where the South is it's actually a type of tuna kit or some people might know as a sea squirt but they're kind of like a clear ball animal yeah it has a siphon so yeah to move you barely see it do you really go like bring it out of the water to look its it clear but then it has an orange like something in our stomach when you see that has food in it ah yeah but basically what makes tuna kids special is it's like it's a gelatinous organism but it's more complicated more evolved than jellyfish because it has a primary notochord which is what makes it more related to vertebrates like us and then it actually it's closer to a vertebrate than it is a jellyfish mm-hmm pretty cool as a trip I mean I also wonder how many times did we like get up early and just not even look in the water cuz it's dark something like that yeah but even in the afternoon yeah and afternoon yeah you don't see the sea nettles in the morning but yeah when they're well watching triple if they're still plenty and the guests we're still I would take a look at my board every wonder like whoa check your see strainers that's why I told ya yeah the captain's left the boats off until it was time to leave so Caitlin is leaving tomorrow yes and well this isn't you guys not tomorrow when you hear this but today today tomorrow I'll still be gone when you hear this yeah and she's going to wear Cape Anne yeah I'm going to Gloucester Massachusetts to go whale watching with Cape Anne although if Cape Anne is not going we may try and go out of another Harbor if the weather's better down there oh the weather's not looking too good um it's gonna be a little rainy and I think we don't have any trips going out until Saturday but we might go down to Provincetown or something and see they can see right whales from shore there Cape hands and like a potato chip company from there yeah probably brought that up but Gloucester you know that famous port from the perfect storm careful that's it yeah that's it oh that's cool it's definitely small fishing town vibes like even smaller town vibes in Monterey if George Clooney's driving don't get on dude if George Clooney's driving I'm definitely going oh but a Wahlberg yeah I'll be fine with that too step aside boys I could drive this better than you but yeah hopefully I'm gonna see right whales say Wells they've been seeing some pretty good humpback whale feeding action I saw a really nice photo of a say whale side lunging from Cape Cod today so I'm hoping that sighting so they're good they they kind of have the opposite wind pattern in the morning though that northeast wind blows really gnarly all morning kind of like it does here and then backs off in the afternoon usually but where's that in the winter but like our winter weather but then in the spring and summer ours is like northwest wind builds throughout the day whereas there's what else are you expecting to see so it's obviously you want right whales really bad was gonna be there they do have gray seals you can see them a couple different places and but humpbacks is their primary species that they see it'd be nice to see Atlanta quite sided dolphins also oh yeah are you gonna eat chowder chowder I don't know if I mean I don't really like seafood chowder that much only if my grandma makes it just saying you gotta have powder we were having quite a chowder discussion the other day that's why this is even coming yeah County but yeah I don't know um I'm mostly just excited to go out and check in with my my homies over at Cape Anne we're actually gonna do a collaborative project this summer so we're gonna get all of that finalized chat about some world Marine Mammal conference stuff do all kinds of well nerd things and hopefully see some good whales yes you're about the wellnitz conference whoa let me cool that cool would be we can have maybe speakers and movies movies and watching authors whale watching well watching well have blink-182 play oh no everyone these bracelets got money on them making money on something all that water fest like what could possibly go wrong yeah I caught water if I think we can plan it in six months speaking of water I think I ate people no we're talking about we were quoting the fire festival the killer was gonna be out there tomorrow um probably you guys are probably gonna have like a really good week oh you're leaving sweet they're gonna be so many that's true okay when I was coming home from Mexico you saw southern residents I was pissed sitting in the little pause area a baby well and I was like dang you guys can't one up my sightings yeah oh you actually did pedophile be boiled are we that I pet a baby well and I'm pissed at you - because you're like something residents oh well because you can always go do the baby Grabow thing can't tell and then also what was I doing I had like the afternoon off but I'd work in the morning you guys saw those BC transients yeah oh yeah yeah t1 even Slater did briefly but okay you're you okay so get this I just followed someone from the British Columbia Columbia and I don't know who they were I don't even know if I've actually hit follow but they had tagged t1 like 67 instead of 66 and 65 and I was wondering do you think that's like part of the same pod I don't know how they number there yeah it's not like it's like 165 ABC you know it's in wasn't there one with an A and it's yeah it was T 165 T 166 T 166 a and then that for smaller one is probably how the designated is I don't I say like something don't quote me on this but T 66:1 anyone or something like that yeah hold on I mean look at my that's how they do it in California too like yeah kids are a 1 and a 2 Minard notes here but I don't know like do they have their their transients family lines mapped out a little better so the numbers they they're probably closely related to each other or what yeah I guess I do have this it is yeah 51 they are pretty sure those two matriarchs were siblings so that's how they got numbers close to each other but there's some other ones that nothing was really worked out that's just like the order they were documented in that's why I'm all up for just letting them have cutesy names that's a lot of names to remember days I named all the 51 A's you I named them already watch I think a one is an D or something maybe without talking to me first medium medium this ones double XL caps lock things so if you need your pet names just let him know he'll come up with something baseball new this bars got him a cool name again next unnamed killer whale Slater's dubbing it spacebar you think they're gonna allow me to name killer oh there's a bunch of free you're not happy well and make a humpback whale space bar yeah I'm sure give me naming a killer well you're gonna have to fight someone I named one yeah John and I named Richie yeah but other people were like you got all of that too bad he's named Ricky that's my one claim to fame I guess did you figure out this now anyone no iteration a1 sauce music sauce using get a1 a1 sauce yeah it's name what steak sauce then we'll know it's every time we talk about a ones to keep on I think our Florida listeners are thinking we're talking about their highway what damn like a version of PCH it's called like a1 a ice ice baby vanilla ice he talks about Oh anyone a v-twin Avenue that's what he's talking about yeah I thought his later just learn something new for Mary I thought I never thought you would teach something pop culture really yeah anyone a be trained Avenue that's what we talk about it there's no sir random stuff everyone for usually it's related to whales well I think that kid from Jerry Maguire oh my gosh everyone's octopus have three hearts for the brain and one for the body great whales yeah one heart does have like two hearts what is it the oarfish oh the stomachs yeah two stomachs well it's not really technically two stem because I got stomach extension why would fish well anyway now that you got me going about or fish or forget two minutes to talk about okay if you guys know weather or fish it's a very long fish that has been you know estimated to be possibly a thirty feet long but they haven't really found that many full specimens out there when you found mine they were estimating it might be thirteen and fifteen feet long if it was whole but they're really long so in order to possibly spread all the nutrients throughout their body they have kind of like a mass actually how it works but they're thinking they have a they do have this part of their stomach that extends more towards the rear of the body the thing of that possibly might help distribute nutrients you know throughout the body since the animal is just so long so they don't have like crazy blood flow or what I don't know they have a really weird tissue because they know they're not strong swimmers you kind of go with the current they kind of swim up and down the water column so do they have like more primitive circulation where like kind of just free flows and the tissues don't really know that much yeah yeah all I know is the tissue why since they're such weak swimmers it's not firm muscular tissue it's really soft it's like you guys not work if you don't work out you got more you know maybe they don't have very good blood flow so they have to have the nutrients and like adjacent surface area wise to possibly yeah interesting did either one of you well first off did you didn't want of you get that book here at the workout one not yet it comes into the office tomorrow Oh audiobook for my flight cool does anyone read anymore what you guys honey I read about a time for that but I listen to audio books when I'm biking to and from work so much corporate kappa caliber given the dopiest might come up and I'm back with exams but the corpus cavernosa maxilla rests yeah you sound this out for me spell it out bro vana Klee see oh yeah no no if you do google it make sure you put humpback whale people so we just tell them so they don't Google it I don't want anyone get in trouble is gonna google it cuz I'm gonna spell it so it doesn't matter it's the pink thing on the roof of the humpback whales mouth everyone basically there but we talked about that before yeah probably I think it helps them thermoregulate really yeah more water flow through it okay you're asking about the book but was there another question related to that yeah there's something else might completely forgot actually we did we did oh I was watching a predation and by the way the audio exactly halfway through that podcast we paused it in his start again and yeah two of the microphone to God like I don't know they were recording we're not recording sorry so now learning we're yeah and also we're gonna try to save up and get some like better mics eventually yeah okay yeah all right Eric bought his own special mic Nick so he has a really good one for himself you told me by an extra mic so he did upgrade we want the finest for my listeners but anyway the talk yeah I thought it was really good good perspective I like how he straight-out talked about the whole or cut killer well issue the cap the history of captivity was pretty interesting too about you know what happened with namu so that well named namu they thought that it had gotten like a bacteria and for some sort of like it they thought it came from the runoff into the bay there where it was kept mm-hmm and they actually found out that it was from a bullet inside it like it was you know some infection or something but it was from the bullet did this might have died of blood poisoning eventually they say was a fresh like well cuz that same what was that the one no that was Moby that was the one that went down but no this one it just must have been shot while I was out there and it was so fine good thing about it creepy thing is back then they used to shoot at all the killer whales you know they might have a few bullets in it turret on land 50 cows yeah well in all the bullets I never tried a lid so that makes sense that slowly it just died of lead poisoning yeah hence why they're trying to ban out of the let's shot right now end up eating it on accident yeah but I can't wait to read that book the talk was very interesting you know it's crazy the guys like the guy Ted Griffin that captured the killer whales mm-hmm he like grew super attached to namu and then when that whale died he like realized that it was like messed up then he like got super depressed and then he was like you know what I'm just not gonna get attached to them let's keep fishing for him and I'm like wait what you were literally crying you went from crying to saying like let's keep capturing let's catch more it was really weird yeah so then he kept they kept fishing for him yeah how about that beluga whale with a harness on it yeah spy well that was someone writing it like spy tech kind of like how the US Navy has dolphins and sea lions they thought maybe Russia had it beluga whale but there's no tech attached to it just a harness but someone else said maybe it was being trained to be handled for the captive industry and it escaped a sea pen or something yeah Martha miscopied so huh we don't know but obviously you know if they are accusing Russia I'm sure they're gonna be like no no dude I had no idea you put a harness on a whale until I saw that oh yeah I like do didn't even think anyway bro like wouldn't that just keep going like slowly like well other yeah obviously it wasn't meant to like be out in the wild with that thing on yeah it escaped wherever it was but did they do any like type of follow-up tracking with that and washer they took the harness off or they just like let it go I don't even know and I'm also finish the article I don't even know what happened with all the belugas in the pen I heard there were like let him out but I don't know what happened with that either I haven't heard anything since then yeah but these harness on animals isn't unheard of yeah the US Navy has never knows dolphin in California sea lions in their animal training programs yeah they're trained to sense underwater detonation devices yeah and they can put anklets on divers yack them do you remember what they last used the Dolphins for yes operation CPR yeah so that these dolphins were talking about guys yeah they're they're trained to find enemy divers explosives underwater and Navy uses them sometimes like in their shipyards or wherever their ships are you know stored just to kind of patrol the area but they were actually used to actually find some of the last few remaining vaquita also they trained them yeah yeah they did a training run in Tim Cisco Bay and they had them identify harbour porpoise and that test run went well so then they took them down to the Gulf of California and they did find I think the two vaquita that were found yeah I want to thank those two that yeah I'm surprised when they set the bottles in the water they don't just not come back they know that they know where they're gonna get fed that's crazy the trainer's have done a good job of establishing rapport with the animal and they're trained and yeah believe it or not the US government uses cetaceans and other marine mammals in their national defense compacts of lasers pretty soon we should train some humpback cuz they're like the gangsters there's dolphins or is it upon killer whales like get out of my neighborhood we've been seeing Rizzo's a lot too again mm-hmm not that we feel like we see them year-round but but just lately we've I loved em my favorites they're pretty cool there's also unique eject ones are so special yeah I still never seen it yeah I haven't seen Casper this year yet I want to say I was only out in the ocean one time when it was sighted and last year common dolphin really well yeah he should really well ask you maybe about what three or four times a lot okay guys my list is here for Monterey Bay give me a leatherback sea turtle and the albino RZA oh dude look at how many sea turtles we saw last year Slater dude we saw two different residents I've seen 40 killer whales multiple days in a row okay I've seen multiple Adam we do this little battle all we feel like I've argued with you guys every morning Emma actually I always ask you like have you seen this before even though I know you've seen it before because it bothers me like you and your predation two days ago I want to punch you in the ear you salty like last year we had so many Oh Matt because there's no boats going out an afternoon like no one is like going out and I was like dude not one person you're spoiled I think because the labs here I looked at our logs we saw more great well calves get eaten last last year 2017 2018 was my first year 2017 so this it would be the summer of 2017 yeah that's what we saw more great whales get eaten than alive I always thought to live caps and the rest were being consumed that was only in calf I've seen this year there's no gray will Oh in Mexico I saw calves but well I meant on the migration may be sad if you saw one of those great whales you petted getting consumed my parents were like what is it the one we petit I was like I don't think so I looked at the photos on things so yeah mess with them probably look like it's mom no I don't think it was well if it was the one I saw it was a fighter so two one so we we've had great sightings obviously over here I think have you paid attention down south make false killer whales they've had blue whales every day in Newport Beach so if you guys wanna see a blue whales again - yeah I think today they had fin Wells and blew off so if you guys want to see a blue whale and you're in Southern California go go out yeah always ask me like when does he blue whales and it's like when they show up is a good time to see them if you're close to the area and you see that they've been sighted two or three days in a row get out there what's a good time to see whales when they're out there when they're there what time were the whales hmm they'll be there when I get there no oh someone actually asked me they said what time are the whales at and I and I replied on the story and said 3:30 and then someone wrote him and said wait is there trips going out or like they yeah we don't know where the what time the whales are gonna be yeah if we did all the time in Monterey Bay yeah do the whales still come out in the rain yes they live in water stop they don't like water the rain doesn't bother okay thank you all right well you're leaving for how many days six I mean you're gonna have killer whales every day for the next week and leatherback sea turtles maybe turtle and the harbor eating salads I'm gonna cry we're probably gonna see a letter back riding a basking shark you're welcome cool like oh yeah I want a basking shark to meet you yeah we're gonna have Offshore's dancing with basking sharks I mean I've seen Offshore's eat a shark before should we make well nerves podcast t-shirts yes would you guys buy a well nerds t-shirt I think they would let us know depends on the color you'd have a selection are gonna be black or white maybe that maybe blue or navy I always ruin white - you know put a picture of Eric on the back holding a microphone it's a good way not to sell sure no it's gonna say well the will still be there when I get there okay well you know let us know what you think because we are really thinking about it what should we call our our listeners our well nerd let's just Adam can be a well nerd laughs yeah I don't know we got to find out if we have listeners we do we get recognized it's kinda scarier I guess all our voices are pretty distinctive come on yeah huh I don't know me yeah they do all right guys thank you so much for listening we didn't have like crazy stuff to talk about this time if you like now it's gonna be a lot about sightings reports yeah yeah and then the random stuff we hear about whales and the news or something so yeah but yep it's exciting time in Monterey with the killer woes we're starting to get more frequently encounters with them more frequent encounters with them hopefully it picks up even more yeah we'll see you next few weeks is kind of the peak so I thought it was mid-april those a peek mid April to mid-may okay hopefully it's a mid or early May to me to me I'll see what happens but it's been great out there I mean but it's wow it seems like the predations have been stealing the show but those humpbacks have been great too and will wish Kaitlyn a hopeful northern northern right whale yeah you better you better have some good right well stories and chowder's chowder stories I'll take say whales and so you better get New England clam cherry don't get that red stuff all right thanks for the singing if you guys don't follow us on Instagram its well nerds and hopefully we'll see you out whale watching sometime bye bye bye everyone

hello everyone and welcome back to the well Nerds podcast hey everyone whoa you just freakin ruin intro hello everyone welcome back to the well Nerds podcast this is episode number 20 my name is Slater and I'm here with Eric and Caitlyn now I'm gonna talk hi she listened like four episodes and then she just started going to all the intros I never say my name not once no you got better at it no I guess I never see my name who are you probably listening like that first couple are who are you mysterious introduction man later all right you guys Kalin's back that's me you were on the last podcast so how would they know you're gonna I guess we told them you're asking you guys did you miss her yeah I feel like I talked to you the entire time because you called me every time you saw oh wait we don't know what Caitlyn saw you kept calling me though yeah find it right well yeah I'm like no stop asking all right so did you Caitlyn went to Gloucester what'd he say Gloucester Massachusetts to search for the mysterious into Atlantic northern right whale yes and we found him finally after four days I'm about you know from land nice so the first day I flew into Boston we drove down to where they'd been reported along the beach but it was really foggy and so we didn't see anything so then we drove all the way down to the end of Cape Cod Bay Pat liked to Provincetown it was just like two and a half hours we went out to race point and when we got there we saw something splashing and we'll oh my god hopefully it's right well and it was just a breach in humpback which oh just a breaching hole and they never see breaching whales and I was like yeah I watched a gray whale predation the day I was supposed to fly out from shore in Carmel so there was that yeah so we went down the race point we saw quite a few humpback whales we saw a gray seal we saw a lot of good bird activity but no right whales so then we went back up the coast and we kept searching around and we just never could get them and after like eight hours we're like okay it's raining it's still not that great of visibility let's just go get food and then go back to Gloucester so that was kind of a bummer did you get chowder no wait question when you saw the whales from beach the beach huh what did you feel it because there's like a big restriction on how close you can get to them anyways right for right whales yeah from the boat so do you feel like you got closer from the beach anyways yeah how close do you think they were to you like 400 yards yeah so that was like breaking rules breaking rules so so we put out the word to one of our other friends up there who works at a Provincetown named Joanne and we were like okay well we're still looking for right whales I'm here to like you know Monday night basically so if you hear anything let me know so then Friday we just like we're on standby in case somebody had a report online like set of Center for coastal studies or someone else and we just like took the day at home because it was raining all day so we're like yeah we're not gonna drive around the rain again then Saturday we went on the boat out of Gloucester so Jamie works for Cape Anne whale watch as a naturalist so we went on on the hurricane too and in the morning we saw us a whale like 20 minutes outside the harbour and I was like yes lunch feeding on your story or something yeah so we saw it's a whale but it was like being a typical say well and it was like not that cool like every smaller yeah we like past it and I was like okay then we wait like way out on Stellwagen bank and we saw a few humpbacks and a few say whales minke whales and fin whales kind of all sneaking around and we got to see atlantic white-sided dolphins yeah it's really cool do they look much different from yeah it's they're way different than ours I'm just happy they're way more stocky and bigger and their face is more short more rounded mm-hmm and then their fin is way more pointy have you seen them now thank you I'm just like two up dust bro yeah come on Tris well we should go maybe they'll still be there when we get there I invited you guys you can sell there right now it's sunny houses by good day to a Spartan it's sunny in Monterey let me ask you something what who do you think you are seeing two species that we haven't seen well then he got better so the morning trip was like all right you know uh-huh so then in the afternoon we went on again at 1:30 and it was windy in the morning but it laid off in the afternoon so there was a report of like surface feeding whales like further down on Stellwagen bank like further away and luckily their boats are all like super fast over there most boats do like at least 18 knots if not right because they have to go far for the whales like the whales were 23 miles away one way work for us it's like the whales are like eight yeah way jeez 23 yeah 23 miles away one's a shelf or something yeah there's a couple like little bathroom it trick features there but it's overall it's not deep like it's really shallow the whole way out like less than 300 feet pretty much the whole way mhm and so we went way out there and I kept seeing in the morning we heard a report of like a fishing boat that like capsized and so we I kept seeing something floating and I was like telling the captain are like dude what is that over there and he's like I don't know I was probably nothing and I was like no dude there's like something floating over there he's like that's a boat I'm like no there's something else next to the boat uh-huh so then we got closer and I was like hey we should go look at that like yeah we by that capsized boat that was from the morning he's like no we're not near there and then I was like um I think it's a dead whale and he was like are you sure and I was like yeah and I handed him the binoculars so we went over there and it was a dead humpback whale oh yeah so I was kind of a bummer you see there's also pretty interesting cuz like they know they're whales really well out of Stellwagen bank because they have high site fidelity there so the same whales come back year after year after year especially when they have calves and so it was a whale that was known it's called vector she's born in 1984 and she had five calves that they know of over her life and she did drift ashore by Friday which I was already back in Monterey by then and they need crops either but I haven't seen any results and then another whale washed up in New York like the next day and that one was definitely ship strike so that brought them up to 96 dead humpback whales since 2016 oh geez and how's their population tonight yeah their population was delisted like the Mexican ones were for us so they're doing pretty good you know no I don't but vectors normally seen actually in the Bay of Fundy she like kind of stops off through Stellwagen on her way up but she's normally sighted way further north in the summertime so but it's kind of interesting that they have like the full history of their whales you know like they know him really well so after we saw the dead whale we went further out and there was lots of like bird and whale activity and we got to see lunge feeding say whales incredible it was awesome like vertical or know it's like side lunging wrong side yeah kind of like a fin well what are they feeding on copepods I think can they vertical lunch maybe yeah I mean I feel like the humpbacks vertical lunge because they had that ability like propel themselves upward with their flippers there's like the other whales they have little PEC fin so they can't it's kind of funny because they used to always say oh no they don't use their pectins at all but then finally they have that video from what two years ago where you actually see them actually using yeah yeah that created that like underwater footage from Cascadia and Hopkins and stuff in the gold dogging lab and then some drone videos I mean even insulators drone videos you can see him using their bands yeah and I remember talking to you before he actually came back about that the humpbacks feeding - what was that technique there use oh yeah so then like later in the week we went out again and on Monday which is like my last boat trip before I left they were kick feeding or send Sunday Monday Monday they're a kick feeding so they like do this the humpbacks they like pushed out their PEC fins and like bring their tail up in this huge art and then like slam the whole tail stock in that fluke down and like stun the fish and then they go down under the fish and blow bubbles hmm and then they come up and do like this trap feeding move where they just ascend really slow with their mouths open Wow I've been doing it for a while yeah that's like a normal that's what memory did you see videos from Iceland remember they were kinda just like all coming up in a line and doing like it's right below the surface they're doing yeah like a chop but yeah yeah and their package would all come up kinda but they weren't using their back face oh I saw a whale from Iceland also on Saturday morning there was a whale with a really really white flute that was not in the catalogue like the main catalog that they keep on the boat so then this lady that goes out with them Nancy who used to be an educator she like goes and just IDs all the whales and she found out later that it's a whale that's normally like further up in the North Atlantic yeah I saw it could be you could have seen the same way I have it unhappy well they're like the ones that I the IDS I did get yeah look at it again yeah yes you said to notifications like yeah yes I was pretty sweet and then okay so that was Saturday then Sunday we went to the right whale festival in Boston and that was pretty cool there's this group of kids which I don't know if did they come to ACS or whether at the Marine Mammal Congress they are at the Marine Mammal conference they're called the Calvin ears and they're these kids that are 7th and 8th graders and they like do like this study group thing around right whales it's like they can enroll in this like extracurricular program basically and Calvin the right whales like their little their little mascot and so they were there and they were talking about like the new technology with like the breakaway lines for lobster pots and how that's gonna hopefully reduce the stress of entanglement cuz the whale will be able to actually break the ropes they talk to just like general education about right whales there were lots of people there talking about you know seafood choices and entanglement risk and all kinds of stuff there was really cool art and I was helping my friend Cindy and Jamie with their booth in a box project for a year of the right whale which is gonna be next year in 2020 and so they're trying to have these boxes sent all over the country and someone is like the keeper of the box and people can check out the box from them for their events so you basically have this free tabeling set up where you can go teach bilbo people about North Atlantic right whales wherever yeah that's really convenient that's pretty cool so then since we are already part of the way to the right whales where they'd been seen from the beach all week because we were getting reports all week that they were seen from shore and it was just killing us we're like well we're already half way down here let's go look for right well uh-huh so in the afternoon we went down to gusset Beach and there was 12 right well Wow yeah and let people know what the population is that's pretty so that one of the population in one mile stretch of beach there's like 411 not including the calves because they want to see if they survive the summer basically and so there's 8 calves or 7 seven caps reported this year and there was a mom and calf pair there I'm pretty sure cuz one whale was like skin feeding and this other whale was just rolling around next to it the whole time we're there for like three hours when there's right well season again for that area well it kinda has been shifting so last year they saw right whales the first like two weeks of May and so I was like okay well I'll try and go out there that's why I picked those dates but Center for coastal studies has been seeing them on their aerial survey since mid-april so they haven't been visible from shore from the boat too often but the aerial surveys have seen them for over we should go Slater next year hopefully they'll still be there when we get there cuz that's also they had good say well action a lot the first like April and May last year as well I'd be stoked to see that that's like a new thing I guess yeah that would be well Jamie was like well we only really seen him on twenty percent of trips but then her and Cindy were talking and they're like actually I feel like we've seen them a lot more the last year or two Hey okay well speaking of dolphins that we don't see a lot the northern right well dolphins have been around like crazy yeah I tried to Alton was a guy watching like 12 times so they lived here now I can't say that yeah it's been days in a row like two weeks straight now yeah look at log here but they get the exact number but it's been insane yeah every day we have seen in northern I would often I think sweet in the white side it's too hard we didn't get to see him on that wait yeah after you saw the norm right whales is that your last day yeah that was our last day and then you came home and then I came home and did you go on the boat right away yes you came home I grabbed for my all day trip yeah I came home and went on the boat on the 10th yeah so yeah Freddie all right look at our logs when you see on Friday Katelyn like 400 Rizzo's 70 Pacific white-sided dolphins and two humpbacks in the morning and then afternoon the fifty ones so for killer whoa whoa what they do the oh my god bumper nailed the seal and right next to the boat well none of us were really paying attention I've never seen it I mean like I've seen them has he Lions but this was like it was real how fast was it it was like instant it's funny big white wall of water and then the sea lion was gone we're looking we're all laughing and we're like this sea lions look like it's funny cuz most of the potters already like a quarter mile away don't forget what boat found them for you okay now at this time when I saw them in the morning yeah Eric Samba for us did you uh he didn't see you Rizzo's and northern right well doll I mean and Pacific why's that dolphins the wrist was actually led us to the fifty ones but what's crazy is we saw a comet actually a little comment you know her own little sea line it was pretty intense she okay about that what time of day was that I think so she killed it towards me and you know what we had well luckily they kind of took his back towards moss so it was probably around you know towards the end of 11 or 12 ish or so because our Rizzo's down in Carmel Bay at like 12 started freaking out there were chin slapping and breaching they also all picked up speed inside Russia yeah we were awesome awesome then slowly getting closer and closer to moss so we were pretty far from yeah they could still hear it though I'll tell you what I think they killed a couple sea lions there are they it seemed like it everyone yeah everyone killed their own like their comment like spy hops like they were still kind of playing around something yeah they were great nothing and then they all split up and then bump her got his own bumper totally dragged the sea lion all the way back over to yeah yeah and then you see star like crosstalk faces fill up a lot and it was funny to see little comet by herself zig and zag when she finally got that one we knew she actually got to kill because she had an intestines draped over her back Orion came and just like guys snatched it from her noon and they were just like side by side of his kind Z funny we saw a comment do the same thing she like went after something real quick and then kind of stopped yeah but I was telling her just kinda neat since we see the 51 so much you know and I've seen her since she was yellow it's like literally watching your little girl grow up you know she made her own she's so little I can't believe she's almost she's like basically eight years old a lot yeah they do the fifty ones particularly it's a lot and I don't think she's like learning anymore I think she knows how to kill oh yeah I mean they just killed her great well yeah they did I saw that before I left about yeah the day before you laughter that day that day yeah honey we were talking about how they never really kill sila or a gray wells that much and they were and then the c-51 spite himself for whales killed yeah well that's so funny yeah we were just do I checked in the morning whale watch and were you on the boat Erica's naturalist no Britt was it was me yeah me Britt and welcome to come to Carmel kill I was actually on the other side of bang you watch the aftermath yeah I came home yeah so I was going home to pack and get on the bus to go to the airport and I jumped I saw Slater went live on the Instagram so I was like I wonder what they're looking at out there and I saw the killer whales killing a gray whale and I looked in the background I was like they're in Carmel Bay yep and so then I was like you know what let me throw together a few things in case I get stranded down there for a couple hours and then I checked your livestream again and you were still alive so I just got drove down there so I watched it from land on the scenic loop on that like on that Big Bend yeah before the Carmel River State Yangtze and then I was standing there narrating for like all the looky-loos there on the corner for two hours you know they so they stayed there Slater eventually in the morning yeah that's when they drove them into the bed yeah so he got to see him literally from the boat and then on land and we finally left because Slater got hungry it was like really good humpback dolphin activity on the world we know yeah because they got pushed really far anyway so then we left and and then it's funny cuz we're like oh there's some bird works and then it was like oh there's Oh humpback breached and then like we were like we started going that way and there was like 15 humpbacks hopped up thousands of dolphins flattest most Christmas there blue water yeah yeah and then of course it was at the end of our trip and I was like no and is Margaret thousand can I please go on another trip yeah cuz I called so I I was texting you the cat when the calf died cuz it died after you guys left on the boat yeah yeah our breaching yeah I got a few really distant breach photos from sure and then I called JJ and was like hey just so you know like the calf's dead they're starting to eat there are a few boats down there but it's so far in there for the three hour trip and afternoon you're not gonna get back there and he's like it's okay cuz I just found where we're going for the afternoon mother and he told me about it and I was like wow way to rub it in since I'm not on the boat how calm did it get in that Bay though in the afternoon remember it was like yeah it was great it was beautiful evening was so nice they were just sitting directly in the middle of the bay they would go down feed in the night all good they come back up yeah beautiful backdrop we have a Carmel River in the backdrop in Point Lobos so yeah they saved it for quite a while it's pretty awesome and then in the morning Erik and I which he was supposed to go check the bay in the morning and he didn't because they're happy luckily yeah on Cates bow and not even ten minutes out of the harbor Cates like look at those two humpbacks and then like wait a second those are small bows to do humpbacked and then if she ate with you ones we're headed right at it yeah they follow me the work is pretty cool well watching actions been great everywhere I mean down and SoCal they've had some incredible blue whale stuff mandolin treating the other day and then good good action in Monterey good action in Santa Barbara and then over on the East Coast whale watch seasons really just starting to get going and it sounds like they're all having great trips out of all the harbors in Massachusetts so Washington's still seeing very Wells and then transients mm-hmm I can't wait to hear about l-pod going back there whatever they do will be interesting to see who and talking to our friends from up there who it was been a long span since they see them right what was the last anywhere yeah it was a long time maybe you'll find out in the future episode yeah I think we'll have some guests coming up here soon yeah honestly though like at this like after my trip to Massachusetts I'm like man whale friends are the best like Joann kept me posted all week about the right whales and I finally did get to see them because she told me exactly where they were and I still to this day never met Joanne in person oh really yeah that's cool like one time she just put me and Jamie on her boat she's like oh I'm not naturalist a day but just go down there and check in it's all taken care of and we went out with Hyannis like two years ago when I went down there and then yeah and then this time I was like oh can you please at least like come to the beach and see the whales with us like we still never met you and she was like I wish I could go but like I know some other people that are down there maybe you'll run into the so yeah well people are pretty cool yeah we're pretty tight-knit field yeah what else lots of dolphins dolphins have been no it was crystal I mean how crazy was that water it was amazing like 30 40 feet down yeah and there was all you could watch northern right well dolphins all you could watch Pacific white-sided dolphins about riding together rolling around and then humpbacks everywhere everybody clear south of Carmel yeah it's so clear right yes they in fact your trip did pretty well have a list it was humpbacks Whiteside its northern right whale dolphins fur seal tufted puffins and salmon sharks and the brown now oh yeah like not just one brown ales like for three for sure like three and bluefin tuna and the weather was awesome the entire day yeah black on you got so lucky remember how much you were freaking out like is it gonna be okay bro well I knew the weather wasn't good Oh like you know since I was checking the seven days out yeah but I mean think about all winter when you're like is it gonna be okay for my out date started that your ice so the trip out in February I had from February to May to just have anxiety for the trip but yeah it turned out really good we didn't see killer whales but I wasn't really sad about it what we had was absolutely incredible epic yeah there are some people who really want to see you know things that weren't from the Aryan they got to experience it so we're happy that we checked off a lot yeah from some people's list you may hear about it I don't know I don't know the future and the tipping is the stuff showed well too it's like if you couldn't get it a spectacular shot of a white side or a brown oh yeah they seen him like once and I've never gotten in photos and the next day we had him again yeah you might need to tell people what brown ales are so they're like a color pattern that's like almost opposite of a normal white side there's a lot more white over the eye starting at the front of the snout all the way up over the top of the eye going towards their back yeah Kate described as almost like a white face mask and then on the side of their body where it's normally white it's actually dark so it's like almost opposite of their normal color okay yeah this is really great and then yellow that said it's kind of yellow that yeah stripers yeah it's kind of yellowish yeah I don't know if that's because they have diatoms on them or if that's like it's a sort it just looks that way you know I look closely at some just regular white sides and if you look Jim in your photos I'm just kind of mess with a little does seem like white sides always have a little bit diatom yeah exactly yeah right by their face yeah I really do prefer cold water so that would I mean that's not too unusual I think another thing that me and Slater know this especially now that we're seeing so many you know on the right Dalton's in Pacific wellhead side dolphins they are so active over here just find out a water otherwise yeah the white sides it's just insane that comes under California's like oh that's nice you're just swimming around yeah dolphins did some good leaps to we were always pretty distant when we would see them but yeah they would do repetitive leaps like like I don't know if we caught them the right time of year what cuz we saw a lot of baby dolphin making - maybe yeah they were just so calves and they all had yeah they really are my favorite right well dolphins I really want to see southern right whale dolphin so that I can claim they're my favorite [Laughter] yeah he was your them all day today it's like they just got a little bit more white yeah they almost like penguins you see this profile it's just amazing like you look at a normal right whale dolphin no dorsal fin you're looking at like how do you work you know yeah did they just like constantly do you like 360 and their dorsal fin and then the flukes to our little neuro they don't match the proportions are so tiny like how do you work I like that what about the white side sink oh so we had a yeah what day was that where we had the big the day that was Friday there was a big pot of Rizzo's yeah okay all of them were preaching but if you looked so right when I was I was in the bow and we saw a wife this all resevoir like one o'clock and a wife's had left our bow went over to and I think did a little chin stop right next to it so realize you're probably shoo fly don't it every time every time you saw chance let me see your white side come zooming by next to it out in the distance so I think the white side and the ridges were actually like kind of playing somewhere really or just messing with each other yes and the ridges were doing it non-stop like every that's really cool good Rizzo's encounter Rizzo's yeah yeah and they were like that all the way from point P nose down to Cyprus point where we picked him up again on our way home yep which is pretty awesome and it was home and it was warm it was nice it was a nice day on the bay what else do we have coming out he's going anywhere mmm nothing playing it's so busy here we're gonna stay here and yeah show off our whales make some money yeah we are slow winter not slow but as an just winter was just yeah tough weather all winter dollars did we talk we talked about the blue the world news well there was another there was another update yeah only the harness one this zone this cellphone was there something else now what so the after that think about the cell phone up mmm well I've been looking I've been checking that show I was looking at last night at the park and first off the things been hanging out every day yeah it's really friendly with you and they tried feeding it like fresh car like really fresh fish you know what they didn't take it I guess so they think that I might be feeding like they think that it might be finding food on it yeah they think that I might be finding food on its own weights is now with the harness the same one that brought my cell phone yeah and hammerfest yeah my god and another thing is yeah they think that they just recognize it from a photo from captivity a beautiful facility yeah yeah yeah how do you idea blue the whale this machine of the shade of white no no hope that changes as they're out in the ocean sure they probably just ask for its ID oh well that one dude you get is a scam bring a wallet out yeah that was if you guys don't know what we're talking about there was a clip of beluga hammerfest yeah a beluga whale like with a cell phone in its mouth on water looking at a boat full of people and it just like slowly ascends and like comes in spy hops basically with the cell phone in its mouth and the lady grabs the phone and the blue galettes it go and like yes yeah she dropped her phone you can tell this well has been trained yeah it's very people friendly yeah I mean and another thing I think that we have brought up when we first talked about the harness thing and people like oh my god it's spy tech our own Navy in the US has dolphins and sea lions as part of its training programs so they have military trained cetaceans and other marine mammals hmm they're trained to like detect like bombs underwater they can put anklets on divers to track them they can do a couple different things that the bottlenose were used in the key to CPR operation CPR to locate the vaquita is to hopefully live capture them so yeah they never captured any though they found two one capture and then when they let go yeah cuz anyone today yeah yeah but then it was probably died and then passing yeah yeah so they're pretty much out for the account yeah yeah there's rumors that it's single digits now we're talking like six maybe so that's an annotation that's gonna go extinct in our I was talking someone they don't I don't think they hope obviously they hope not but the southern resident killer whales I don't think they'll go extinct at least in our lifetime it's just like the vaquita you know you gotta get everyone's attention before there's just only twelve animals like there's a lot of great accounts out there that are trained yeah so upcoming as far as the events if you live in the Monterey area ACS is at the end of the month last Thursday of the month on the 30th sorry chase Decker oh nice yeah he's got amazing photos yeah he'll be talking about I think mostly humpback whales but I think kind of just whatever that's cool he's a nice guy yeah it'll be interesting um otherwise World Oceans Day is June 8th do something fun Jimmy yeah no I'll be here do you mean you better be doing something ocean really yeah my workshop oh right yeah so you know make something I'll be going well yeah there you go go Slater to his workshop but back to that ACS meeting I think we always push that a lot it's a good learning opportunity for you but if you're not in the Monterey area most chapters have a monthly meeting and it's usually towards the end of the month so find out in your area if you can go actually I've met a few listeners who lieutenant oh so good job everyone yeah usually San Francisco's is like the Tuesday the same week as ours and then down in SoCal I don't really know what their schedule is yeah not sure they're scheduled but ACS Orange County and ACS LA I'll have many members really really really really good talks and completely free Jenna open to the general public so we went in the past to your trip and then now we're I think I'm gonna jump all the way to the future but then we're gonna go back into that future but in the future just letting you know Adams in Santa Barbara today oh he did yeah he said can you let the world know hot off the presses it was Emma's group right you were showing me the photos it's Emma's daughter Emma's not there and his daughter and grandkids yeah cool stuff they'd have friendly wells at Santa Barbara didn't they I saw a video from those oh yeah humpbacks yeah little back whales I'm getting some amazing sightings there yeah yeah just send me a basking shark a shark yeah I would not care for a lot mm I know I got what I've asked for so far though those were my what I told you what were the three things I wanted to see when I went out there neither share dolphins lunge feeding say whales and North Atlantic right whales and I'm sure oh do do you guys think did you guys see the video of the basking sharks in Scotland showed up oh yeah well I didn't see it but I know they have them there rate yeah they got some pretty amazing consistent sightings there do you think snorkeling program there - oh really yeah I know people kayak with them I didn't know you could snorkel like I don't want to do that that could be another whale night strip yeah yes indeed hopefully they're still there when we get there so hop backs we finally got a good one a lot of good lunging today what sea lions it's it's pretty much summertime once you find the bait ball is easy to keep track of where they're gonna eat it they were wolfing down those anchovies hi are you guys today yeah soft sigh breasts are wearing something sure yeah everything's been pretty much yeah outside and that little like this little strip it's kind of normal this time here we'll see if it funnels into the canyon or not some years it just stays out on the edge out there all year yeah we started off with scattered out Pacific white-sided dolphins in northern right whale dolphin yep and then there was humpbacks there as well and then we went out and saw the lunch feeders yeah I'm all to ourselves yeah no matter that was nice you don't have to share we're so spoiled Monterey very spoiled well I think that's it it's a shorter episode by this time yeah but we have some other episodes coming up yes and they're exciting yes yes all right you guys make sure if you don't already to follow us on instagram at whale nerds yes please leave us comments or concerns questions maybe just DMS the concerns I always later can read them and yeah thanks for listening you guys hopefully enjoyed this podcast and hearing about Kaitlyn's experience over on the East Coast yeah let me know if you want more info about going out over there I'm happy to share it with you yeah awesome bye thanks for listening everyone you guys

hello everyone and welcome back to the Whale nerds podcast this is episode number 21 I have Eric and Kaitlin here hello hey everyone and we also got some special guests with us today we have Jeff and Sarah we're down here from the San Juan Islands which is an amazing place for whale watching [Laughter] yeah and they came out while watching with us on one of our all-day trips this week and we want to hear about their experience and how they feel about the Monterey Bay there too the San Juan Islands hmm how many first it you guys have first resource dolphins first and definitely by far the most Pacific white-sided dolphins I've seen one awesome else oh yeah they're kind of brown-nosed I guess if they have a lot of diatoms yeah Caitlin you might have to explain to people what exactly a Brownells is yeah so there's a unique color morph sometimes they call in color aberrations for several different types of dolphins but there's a specific one for the Pacific white-sided dolphin that the the white patch on the side actually is more dark and then they have like this racing stripe up over there I it's almost like a big white eyebrow mark and sometimes it goes down onto their snout to so it's just like it almost is opposite kind of I thought that but then it's I cut yeah it isn't it isn't it's like has a weird like yeah there's a lot more white over the eye so and then why did he get to name it brownells well that's his name and I wondered how they looked at in in their community like are those like a cool dolphin I mean it is genetic so and more today we saw more yeah we had two two of them today oh cool yeah so I wonder if they're I don't know if they were the same she thought for sure one of them look kind of dig herds of them coming through the area you're more likely to see one of those weird color patterns I've seen a different type of one as well that would like almost the whole head was white that wasn't a brownells type now I'm wondering if brown ales are only here with our Pacific white-sided dolphins or if like some other stocks or up there you know might have it so I've seen like on the Cal coffee surveys which goes like up and down the whole California sometimes even up it further they've seen them offshore and then a lot but a lot of the footage comes from honoring yeah that's just we realized that we should look into how many times a year do you think you see Pacific Whitesides or do you see it I mean we we do see them they're they're more typically seen further north in Britain British Columbia and in the inland waters in Washington we'll see him a handful of times a year sometimes they come through in huge groups other times we just have like a really small group that come in with the southern resident killer whales and I think me and Slater actually talked about this the other day did you guys notice any difference in the activity level between your Pacific Whitesides and our Pacific Whitesides you experienced yesterday I think overall I think you're probably a little more active here okay have you seen him do the flips you have now I have never seen that before that was you know it was awesome and in SoCal no one yeah you're like a sleep in Southern California yeah they don't even porpoises so Jeff and Sarah both see the resident the southern residents quite often up in the San Juan Islands and we had l-pod down here we borrowed them for well there was a pretty good shot of Sam in there at the beginning they must have known that so they followed it down and it seemed like there were tons of salmon boats again today so something must have happened there's a lot more today I think they're just mostly hopeful they might have been hopeful that they were gonna get a bluefin tuna that's warm now it's like sixty degrees in the water and there's schools of bluefin tuna all over the bay in May you know I asked Randy Randazzo's 96 he used to own the salt today yeah the building that I that we all work in if he'd ever seen bluefin tuna this early in the year and he said never in his life really yeah interesting this is the second week of May is the typical like he's you know June July but more like August September and probably not in many years anyways it's not like it's no no no I mean we've we've seen bluefin two out of the last five years I've been here but it's been the fall yeah October yeah I remember some people talking about the resident up there was there any like chatter once they heard they were down here oh it was it was huge news it really went through it was it made it through the whale watching community up there the sighting networks probably faster through our sighting networks than it yeah you're a whole sighting no oh wow yeah yeah I mean that that morning everybody was like Elle pots been sighted and we're thinking we're going out to CL day [Laughter] we're always telling people how these are not resident to the yeah exactly and that these whales travel long distances and it's great to wouldn't that happen to be able to say this is what we're talking about when we say these are largely coastal whales and they're moving long distances and that's what they have to do to get through and the amazing thing is when we spotted them they were coming from the south to cuz so who knows how far they really know work yeah we saw the bluefin that's where we picked up on them so Wow so kind of where we were today that's where we picked up on him they were headed north and that's why I'm in awe I think of where with it where did he go how would he turn around cuz our last sighting I believe that anybody had had seen l-pod was in mid mid January when they were in front of the Victoria Harbor Wow with really a potty on Cape Cod it was right after L 124 yeah for the calf how many times do you get the super pod of all of the residents nothing nearly what it used to be back in the days what before the big crash of chinook salmon people were betting what when when in May would be the first super pod we now have years where we don't we never see a super pod are you talking like pre 90s or even in the in the 90s they used to be a one of the best months we'd see see them almost every day in the month of May last year we didn't we had not one sighting of a southern resident killer whale in the inland waters last May for the first time ever so we when we saw the super pod in January for me personally I think the only the most recent super pod I had seen before that where every single member it was a full Asheville super pod what 2015 Wow yeah and was there more southern residents then there were how many no move over that then they were in the yeah you remember 99 just got chills from that I didn't even know about them until they're at 75 you know or 78 or something like that mm-hmm that's great it's the first whales I saw it's a kid I'm pretty sure the southern residents really amping up in the San Juan Islands oh cool and we're pretty sure we're going out to lime kiln and we're like in the parking lot my mom's like trying to set expectations she's like okay we might see way out here like sometimes we see whales here don't like no mom there's whales here and we walked out there and there was like 30 that's the first time I remember seeing them all right and one it says that because at one point that footage was long yeah well now the best northern residents yeah so that's a 100 miles north of us in Columbia and that's where they northern residents code down shallow beaches there's now a ton of water at even at high tide and it there like flat rounded stones and they go down and just rub along the bottom funny a Harvard still goes by in a residence she wasn't really mad at me in my Katelyn lookup perfect in the corner it says like highlight its read to so it seems I could say and that beach I heard it is not easily accessible or even accessible to the public right you can't so that top side camera that's mounted there too it's like someone just goes checks it every few weeks or something then I think it's it's all solar so I think they just go and make and change the batteries out like once a season oh cool yeah it's kind of a good thing [Laughter] we argued we're testing the live camera system and they put one camera in right off of Orca lab and I remember spending like an entire Saturday I had it counted in the background just watching an urchin crawl so did you guys used to have the resident early in the spring or is it cuz now you guys tell me to come like September like fall right so historically the southern residents were present in inland waters every month of the year we would see them every single month j-pod especially and that has changed significantly over the last five yeah historically like January you'd see them maybe one or two days but and then you know February you'd see them a little bit and then from May through September to mid-october you'd see them almost every single day and those numbers since 2005 have just been steadily decreasing is this because we think of the decline of food and they're spreading out more to go search more transient as well either no well I don't think it's because of the transients I mean it's what's going on in the inland waters in Washington and British Columbia is probably a similar story of what's going on in a lot of other places where you have a changing ecosystem and in every changing ecosystem there are there's wildlife that benefits and wildlife that doesn't and I think with the decline of salmon obviously the southern residents are losing with that but with the increase in the pinniped population the transients are benefiting from that and so we're seeing the transient orcas much more than we've ever seen them I saw I saw somebody mentioned one of the one of the whale watchers and companies that guy's been around since the mid 90s said that it used to be that the we would see the transient orcas maybe 2 to 3 times a season and now it's it's almost everyday every single month of the year yeah Wow even 10 years ago when I was doing this you know I would see transients maybe once or twice a season for me I mean but in last or 2017 I think we documented over 670 sightings and Wow dividual metro lines even on our spring spring tours they we used to tell people that in the spring you'd see maybe one out of one or two out of every ten tours would see killer whales and now we're seeing them almost I would say like 9 out of 10 well during during the spray thanks agree since I think since in the last probably 75 days I think we've had less than five days without killer whales that's amazing now I know we we discussed this amongst ourselves but probably our listeners probably are curious to describe the relationship between like transients and residents and though sometimes you guys actually will see them in the same vicinity what usually happens when that occurs instances where they seem to like the residents pushing the transients out of an area chasing them I think the only documented like really interaction was 1993 because it was when j28 was a newborn calf and researchers saw Jay pod chasing like four or five transients including T 20 and T 21 out of an area and they actually like write to the transients like the transients had like the researchers later found that Jay 17 had just had a new calf which was Jay 28 those two were together along with Jay 17 smother j5 in ever since the transients have been scared it's one of the things that fascinates me the most about the relationship on the two because because people ask us all the time when we're out on the water and we don't know what what it's counterintuitive you would think that marine mammal eating killer whales would be yeah I would think the same thing yeah and it's strength in numbers you know it's very possible there's there something happened before that we don't know about yeah roll incident but it's culturally passed down uh-huh and I remember a trip last season I think you were with me and we were up in the Strait of Georgia in British Columbia and we had several groups of transient orcas coming down the straight really really fast they were porpoising and we were blown away I mean they were porpoising it like 15 knots down the Strait and it was like one group would fly by and then a few minutes later another group would fly by and and the vancouver companies were getting off the dock a little bit north of where we were and they came out of the harbor and they're like yeah we have j-pod right here and we're like oh these guys are flying south because Jim iPods coming yeah wow that's crazy yeah that's what's cool about the boats being like you know all through the islands like you can be like no we have them here that's probably why that's happening down there and then all the communication definitely very cool okay so you guys are was my legacy and where do you where out of the island area do leave them so we leave from San Juan Island we have two locations any one oh and Friday Harbor downtown Friday Harbor and Snug Harbor which is on the west side of the island okay and then there's quite a few companies around there but you guys can kind of cover anywhere right like you're about to you have to go anywhere yeah the San Juan Islands for that region it's we're kind of in a central location to be where the whales and and other wildlife travel when they're in the inland waters so it's a great great departure location for killer whales humpbacks minke whales and one of the most beautiful flat calm water can fester anymore and we had the hydrophone in so we're listening to it you guys are talking to me right up to the northwest places it'd be beneficial to because yeah and your knowledge or just yeah I think that'd be beneficial nobody take my idea we didn't get any pigs that's awesome now what's the huge difference like now that you've been here and they're like what do you guys love about this place what you hate about it the possibilities seem endless to me like when we go out on the walk yeah species you potentially even the rarities like it's just mind-blowing and the dolphins are still blown away by yesterday's dolphin yeah it's it's I mean like whale watching anywhere else I just never know what you're gonna see ya always cool but I was blown away yesterday that we were we spent three hours with Pacific white-sided dolphins and the northern right whale dolphins and it wasn't like we were staying with the same group yeah we were going like two different humpbacks and there were so many dolphins around us the whole time and leave them yeah I mean there were that many and it just blew my mind even we're like we're like oh we're gonna leave there and look for some other Saturday soon as you pick up the pace the Dolphins yeah it's it's incredible definitely I get that feeling every day that's like you never know what you're gonna see any day they'd be here and then the residents come down here and we're like alright yeah like beaked whales sperm whale yeah we had we had we had a trip last last spring end of March and there had been a sperm whale oh yeah up in John Stone Strait area for like a month yeah cool and they were picking it up on the hydrophones and they were they were it was that's a very rare thing and in Washington there's never been a documented sighting they had a thing was the 70s or the 80s they picked one up on the hydrophone no one ever ever saw it and then all of a sudden there was a report that the way the sperm whale had gone started going south and then lost sightings of it and so we were joking that like hey let's go out and find the sperm whale and it was a total joke so we're on a trip and we're going we're actually going to j-pod we've got killer whales we've got residents we're going and we're with j-pod and one of our passengers says they see a blow and it's a couple miles away and from from that distance I thought we had our first returning humpback for the year so we left and we went and we waiting where we saw the blow waiting and didn't see it and then one of the other boats called us they're like hey Jeff we found your humpback it's over here but it's a sperm whale 40 minutes but putting the hydrophone in was coming up because it would stop it's coming up and it was on the radio you can see the spouts coming out of it that's how we were when I first saw sperm was down in SoCal we had a nursery pod and we had like humpbacks which is rare for that was rare for down there at that time and we're like oh we got a humpback up ahead same thing we head down there and then my captain's like whoa those blows are weird and they're all coming out at an angle and 50 of them popped up Wow yeah that's awesome and that happened for ian's later that year was they happened twice they came back like a few months later it was nuts yeah they were playing with bottom I don't know they're playing but the bottlenose dolphin we're swimming with him you know yeah we were saying up here like if they showed up like in the morning like the next day the second time around we were just gonna all ditch work and some some people did people try but then a couple years later we had one in Monterey we had one male for like yeah yeah ever and I saw it on a sea bird trip with Alvaro seabird company and there was a guy on the boat who was like five years ago on this day we saw a sperm whale and he was like and we remembered the back was really funny like the peduncle had extra like curvature in it and it kind of flipped funny and so we like took a bunch of photos and he's like I'm pretty sure this seems like the big males for us here it seems like they have you know that high site fidelity and stuff like yeah but we I mean I just don't know too much about like deciding history of San Californians we had we were on the board yet there was a way only a mango John actually Aidid and he seems like he frequents Southern California every few years so that's friend double scoop or something I thought I heard something about that you guys have whales named after cookies you know so we got our food yeah so one thing that a lot of people always ask us is like how we got into whale watching or whatever so I'll pitch it towards you guys I was like so and for a very very long time Thanks so for me it was it was a natural I I grew up in the whale capital of the world Cleveland Ohio Oregon chapters from like Ohio like they're like way inland State that's funny Ohio ad had Sea World in at least married it was the first first time I ever saw second grade I think for a lot of people that's their first first experience I added when I was a kid I was always very drawn to like ocean documentaries and marine wildlife but being from Cleveland like you didn't you didn't go whale watching and you didn't think about a career around whale watching or honey or any kind of career like that it's just not in your universe but the first time I saw killer whales in the wild I was on a kayaking trip in British Columbia and we had two just incredible experience this was we were camping across the Strait from the rubbing beaches oh cool and we had a Harvest Moon it was dark out and we had this parade of northern resident killer whales going by beautiful experience swimming by underneath us it coming up like below us as we're the next day we had a really close encounter in the kayak when we were water and and that it was like at that moment that I realized it was like that moment I was like I need a lot more time around whales and how can I make that happen and and what if I did this trip every summer and that's not gonna be enough so I started going spending time in the San Juan Islands in Friday Harbor every summer not a lot of time just like a week or two on vacation became friends with two people that owned whale watching companies and they worked really closely together one was legacy charters and the other was Maya's west side charters and when Jim Maya I was talking to him just a few years after after I'd met both those guys and he knew how passionate I was about whales and how how into it I had gotten and he was he was selling his company to legacy charters because Jim had turned 75 and wanted to slow down a bit and I was signed him on the phone one day and he said hey he said I got a good feeling about this what if you bought my company and instead of Spencer and Rachel legacy charters but you bought my company and merged it with them and eight months later I was living on San Juan Island own living the dream an angry man died it's still can't believe that this is actually real life I mean when you have an encounter with whales like that is well that looked like a rock look where he is I watched her in the winter cuz I was in high school and then in middle school so I only win the summer and summer we only went for blue whales in Newport I have a picture on my from like a little I didn't get beat up way way way later he had no idea how lucky was looking at blue whales all the time and then they like stopped showing up and then and then after they stopped showing up we start again humpbacks well there's a few late err but then humpbacks are showing up not really right now photos from down there with the sunset blue whale showers are pretty incredible the last few days like when you like I've seen some awesome drone footage what what's the view like when you're on the boat of seeing a blue it's an enormous back big dorsal fin and then it keeps going more I might get kind of scared when their clothes like yards I'm like oh my god inhale and exhale yeah that's like what makes you like like yeah that's like yeah you see when that splash guard everything comes up you can just tell us massive compared to the humpback and sometimes even the way they come up to this place so much water a little bit of the you know rostrum and even like the lower mandible is exposed you see it's just I mean they make a wait yeah castings especially are good sorry no the other birds that was one of them and this goes back to one of your early questions about comparing that we're watching in Washington versus here I was really taken today with all and yesterday with all of the birds all the bird activity dolphins and the humpbacks of just how alive the bay is mm-hmm and yeah and it may also makes me feel like wow there are times a year that we get like lots of bird activity and use bait balls but Washington State has a lot of work to do on forage fish restoration to know California not too far behind you well we don't have it like I know those inland waters where we are must have been this alive at one point yeah it's just not there anymore and it just it would be really nice to have the the spread biodiversity that yeah going on here back up there as well you know one of the best quotes I saw in one of the books donut the camp akima mm-hmm was this girl who was raised by fishermen and she grew up fishing in Baja and then she's like turned more into a well person and her main piece of conservation is advice is don't kill small animals forage fish don't kill small animals it's really about you rebuild from them from the base rebuild it that way I was just amazed that there was one moment that I really got clear on this when we were out on the boat and it was watching we had some of the northern right dolphins and the Pacific white-sided dolphins and in the thousands and then hundreds of sea lions together and three humpbacks like wow there's so much food down there and it felt crazy and you didn't know where to look and yeah I'm just I'm shooting pictures like shooting from the hip I'm sure I'm getting something in there and it just it it's amazing just like oh we saw like this today and like we're kind of somewhat he said that was really crazy the dolphin mm that's a lot for the whites I especially for me because yeah so but it's funny like it's it's cool to listen to you guys see how amazing it is to have you guys did you see any albatross up there very often what is your bird that you see is there one common berzins marbled murrelet mm-hmm oh cool yeah cuz they nest like along the shoreline there yeah yeah yeah coastal fog and we and we get tons of oh I know you know 20 miles I saw one while I was there yeah but they say they got tons of egos they pretend they got boxes on this island there's no partner how's the Eagle thing changed over the years have you noticed times more yeah when I was a kid growing up in the northwest my mom would get so excited if we saw Michael anywhere cuz they were like in the 90s they crash DDT and then like DDT stop explain it's a chemical no it's a chemical that used to be used in agriculture and it makes their ability to like put calcium in the eggshells like really poor and so they would like sit on the eggs and crush them yeah cuz the eggs would be too thin those shells and so they would like crush all the babies and then like that meant they weren't having babies for years and years and years at a time so their population really crashed so but now I mean stopped using DDT and so yeah a huge rebound that's the same thing at the California condor that was one of the big reasons why they died off so heavily right so yeah towards where the where Eagles are the highlights here well we yeah we had to her last season where we have three socializing humpbacks in glass water and we were the only boat out there and it was just incredible and on the way back we ended up going by this one area we have 15 to 20 bald eagles mom dive-bomber is stealing food from harbor seals yeah and Sarah just got some incredible photos from a trip last week where we had Eagles fighting over harbor seal carcass quick shout-out for their instagrams Jeffs is Orca wild and then Sarah's is [Music] HJ I will watch so for San Juan Island follow all three and share it goes live on most of the accounts so before you came down here I saw you guys jump live on the estuary one yeah pretty wanna see more whales from your phone another cool thing they have up there that we see occasionally is the stellar sea lions they really look like bears that's when they get huge and it's bears with flippers when they first showed when they brought me to that one rock you know it is well rocks yeah man this kid was on another boat Andrea Taylor we're taking fiction these kids are screaming it must have scared them they all just about the rocks yeah they all just jumped like no like three or four of them jumped off the rock into the water we were there twenty five hundred pounders to see them though is when you find a single one and they're being hunted by a transient that would be gnarly because I think how much bigger I mean aren't are transient eat elephant seals but like that's also pretty gnarly to use though it's not it's well in the hunt can last hours yeah guys it's the Stellar's can injure the orcas so yeah they're pretty careful and they're trying to basically they're beating beating them to death yeah it's it can last a long time but if they go after them where you've got a big group of Stellar's we've seen the Stellar's actually chase them off no way yeah yeah big big group of sellers they launched back into the water uh-huh and go after the orcas are leaving fast like they're just like all right fine you go find something else but the Stellar's keep chasing after them it's kind of funny we actually had some of your guys's teas up here last fall hunting a stellar sea lion it was pretty cool we trained them let me check there's a couple there's a couple groups that tend to end up up there yeah we're seeing with going back to what we were talking about earlier with the changing ecosystem I think we're seeing more California transients coming in to the inland water spilly then then previously we've had yeah I think we've had a few that either would have rarely been in or he's been a they've never been in huh well there's we borrowed some of your transients to the old catalog also has like the 97 catalog or whatever that is for California has whales in it that have been seen in Monterey or like somewhere in California but like are frequented off like again or you know like there's whales in there that may or may not actually be a mainly a California coastal whale it I was talking a while back with with Jared towers who's a researcher in British Columbia and he's worked on the DFO catalogues and he said that there will be sightings off the west coast of Vancouver Island where the calve california transients and the pacific northwest transients and they're all mixed together and they're that you know off the coast they are one population and they mix it up with each other but then you have some of the some of them you know prefer California some prefer the inland waters and some prefer the coast Oh up north well and then you have this huge dead spot for sightings that is the Oregon Coast I mean why there's so many fishermen I mean even my dad's like whoa you know sometimes you see killer whales I'm like dude take a freaking picture party nice sturdy boat and we'll just go survey the Oregon coast at the time tease that visited 280 165 and 166 and then they respond off Oregon yeah well we had 167 s I related to 165 166 we had them and they I there I think that's only the second time that they've ever been seen in the traveling mood like Santa Barbara's been seeing ones they've never seen and that I've never shame that they have some remember super rare wine they were when we saw wow that's awesome yeah I mean one there's not a good enough sighting coverage in Northern California and in Oregon but two like there's not enough collaboration and networking of sightings between like you know Southern Canada all the way down to California we have fishermen out there too but sometimes their reports it goes from Orca to oh wait it's original dolphins to it's a pilot those t1 65s that's what happened that day we just got lucky that they actually were Orca right but Slater is on the boat with me they're like oh okay they're just Rizzo's its turnaround oh wait now they're pilot whales oh wait now they're off - yeah I got more that we didn't get to see that could have been from up that area because they were claiming a bigger number and yeah we saw four they were claiming about ten and we saw forward as well so they could have split off in the bay somewhere so funny sixty-five days sevens were with chainsaw when when they came in and chainsaw he's more of a coastal an outer Coast transient that we don't see a lot we see him a couple times a year but he's a badass probably the most recognizable yeah well and I love that because I think that's what makes like especially for our passengers they'd learn these whales they have distinct features like that dorsal fin your name they ended up love when you name the next thing you know you know we probably have our next you know crazy and person crazy about whales or becomes the next great conservation this out personalities they get to be like an ambassador for their species exactly like they talked about that in like the aquariums in zoos like so you know the Conant the Monterey Bay cranes a Laysan albatross she's an ambassador for her species because otherwise when are you ever gonna see a Laysan albatross and so you know these are living ambassadors out in the wild whales that are super recognizable especially you know our residents it's almost like anything like rereleased like Free Willy and look at how many kids we can like get their attention to this situation harmonica as a kid I just so walk by breakwaters and snow at the end and say a little you know whatever I saw later so young he doesn't realize they were mixed in with like some trance some transients we get the you designation I think was basically kind of an unknown know if they were actually California whales when they put them in there but that the motivation of that old catalog was Noah needed some kind of population estimates or like here do it right so there were some whales that they're like wow you don't really see these where they still use here do you have separate so the the numbers the numbers for the like definitely high site fidelity in California RCA and then there's the use that they were like didn't know what to do really and then there was the et PS what's weird n come from we have yeah so the N was like a newer whale to the catalog like right at the end before public oh and actually stands for new yeah Wow simple yeah just know it's in 97 catalog there's a few Offshore's in there that's on I gotta see Offshore's you've never seen what show me your footage like more years than not you at least get one sighting of them but like this year the weather was so rough all winter that they probably went bias and we didn't even know it I did have tons of killer whales oh yeah we saw such large numbers we were confused okay large numbers we're looking at this as well you know [Music] [Laughter] yeah so you guys need a killer whale ID'd from up there just send it to Serbia to get blown up down back to your 2.8 seconds exactly low quality text if you want a quick dance could take a millimeter tall you really couldn't even tell it was a whale but it was laughing right I was expecting you say based on the shadow it's something cool that they found out that j1 they did some testing is actually an L member yeah there's a new paternity paper out as of last fall I think cool yeah and yeah the paternity or yeah j1 is not is there some J&L overlap actually with a few individual whales oh boy it travels with J pod yeah she's not as simple as we thought no like they have some kind of exchange program just like you know Monterey Bay in San Juan Islands are you guys gonna get whale watching company in San Juan Island buddy hangs out in Monterey [Laughter] you know the joke a couple years ago I said I was gonna make like a boat crew catalog of all those people we should do that for the entire West Coast yeah there you go you'd be surprised how much I stay away from this [Laughter] never got to see the one year that I was here those in the San Juan Islands when he was still alive I was out there was a super pod but he I don't know where he was I never saw him who's not canoodling and by the next time I was back in the San Juan Islands he he was he was already gone it's amazing how j1 like j2 they got you know it's like they're icons you know like everyone knows everyone written you know knows about granny and her story and that notch in the middle yeah it's just yeah it's amazing how well can become a celebrity go back to that paternity thing so yeah they inbred or not so yeah there's definitely some inbreeding yeah the paternity paper also showed that Jay 26 Mike is the brother and father of you know I've heard before like in classes and it lectures and stuff they're like oh they're really intelligent animals and like even though they travel in tight-knit groups they don't seem to be inbred but that doesn't really seem to be the case right I mean like that there's there's some other like that wasn't like the most glaring population at least this paper showed so you know was it like an oops on someone else this in the past when the numbers were bigger but now yeah that's true now they're trying to reproduce yeah cuz I'm always quite curious about our transients you know cuz they are cited up there and yours are cited down here and we don't know what's happening off the Oregon coast the other thing is to the 3d pods are spending a lot more time apart from each other than historically other a lot more and now like j-pod for example and we didn't see them much this winter but they were in the inland waters quite a bit this winter they were they were spend a lot of the winner between Campbell River and Vancouver in the inland waters version of the dead zone why this area where there's just there's nothing really going on in there there's no whale watching there's no sighting Network but they were in between that zone for a lot of the winter but isolated from Kay's who's nobody seen I think since January and elves who have only been seen we know exactly so I think part of it is with with the inbreeding and risk of in reading it part of it is is which potentially just gonna compound the issue right I mean your numbers are low and now your genetic pool is getting narrower and that that paper andhe genetics was that the Debra dials people were talking about was a different one or my for my fourth paper okay yeah she presented a yeah a pretty good talk on it is there overlap with northern residents at all in that alternate ePaper not that we know of no no that's a paper that's also pretty interesting that they what we have heard and I'm not sure if this is you know I just was talking with Brad Hanson from NOAA I think he was saying that we're hearing them hearing northern residents G clan on the Swiftsure hydrophone Swisher Bank is a hydrophone there is a bank right out in the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and it's named where J pod has been known to hang out really but they're hearing more calls from G clan down there and so they're speculating that there's increased pressure you know competition-wise for food with G clan coming down this the northern resident population is expanded so much yam what I what I've heard is that when the northern residents come down to Switzer Bank which is just off the off the coast of the southern tip of Vancouver Island and when when the northern residents come down there J pod leaves they think that J pods being out competed for its its Orca drama when your diet is that specific you guys can probably confirm this for me but I heard that the way the salmon usually come back is it true that the Norden residence gets kind of like first pick and the sounds really good leftovers and they come back from there so you know Alaskan fishermen are touching Washington and BC fish what's true Wow Wow okay yeah this other I mean the southern residents have so many different challenges but I think the good part of that is every little bit that we do to help them can have an impact it's like it's not just this like oh if we stop you know fishing from this river it's like there's all these different things that we can do what are those things you guys being you know literally there what are the things that people could do you know the biggest thing that we can do and it's the most immediate thing that would have the longest term impact is habitat restoration for salmon spawning habitat who forage fish habitat in the San Juan Islands for example the same one I always play a big role for salmon in that when juvenile salmon are passing through on their way out to the ocean there they're feeding in the San Juan Islands and so we need more forage fish to get them bigger and stronger for when they're going out and so and and if we have more spawning habitat for salmon we would be getting more salmon going out as well so that's the biggest thing we can do okay I think it's final like salmon are such a cold water species yeah any any change in temperature can really you know having that upstream habitat for them too it's gonna be really important as you know rivers warm and our snowpack kind of receipts and especially on these drier summers and years okay yeah good to know so advocate for saving the small fish yeah dam removal habitat restoration yeah rebuild you budget your water wisely if you live in the northwest well if you live in anywhere anywhere up and down the coast yeah well that's are you well we'll keep you posted on this naturalist exchange program I mean why not people people over by roche harbor i'm coming down next week a borrowed my friends plane all right well we gave you Rizzo's northern right whale dolphins and Pacific white-sided up and said what can we do for you sender and iceboxes bald eagles wow your request list is a little crazy they're both on their Island under-promise thank you for having us yeah again they're San Juan Island my legacy Mayas legacy and it's Orca wild hi Sue yeah make sure you follow them on their instagrams and yeah thanks for listening you guys yeah and follow us too if you haven't been following us along on at whale nerds on Instagram and keep sending us suggestions the topics and things we've had a lot of guests lately but we'll circle back around to those soon yeah thanks everyone for listening and also been running into more and more listeners out there out in the field checking out animals with us don't be afraid to introduce yourself it's been great meeting all of you thank you thank you thanks guys

hello everyone and welcome back to the well Nerds podcast this is episode number 22 my name is Slater and I'm here with Eric and Katelyn hey everyone hello today we're talking about some topics I have no idea what they are but Katelyn knows great whale migration unusual mortality events plastic pollution science depressing stuff yes but it's happening I quite John yeah it's a relevant and current topic in the news all right first topic gray whales yeah it's been a rough northbound migration for the gray whales what northbound migration I seriously don't I've seen two one on my all-day trip the mom and calf that and then the one then the other mom and got that the calf guy eaten for me personally I've only seen two mom in pairs come on baby person I've seen two in that gray whale attacking Carmel Bay I saw the mom leave the area yeah three then oh my god I thought we saw one that one day yeah it's been pretty slow I know our buddies down south of it well I say like yesterday two days ago they saw a few trickling by but yeah it's been pretty pretty low I'm sure it's happened later but yeah in late May before but it's been a long time so what's going on with the great whales they're washing ashore in large numbers this year yeah so there's a lot of whales of all ages dead along the shore from where was the latest one down in Southern California it was really just like gray whale bits yeah it's been it's been everywhere Washington State San Francisco Bay yeah really gotten any news about yeah so it's quite a few think about how many didn't even make it ensure that - right exactly yeah so starting back like in the lagoons when I was down there I don't know if they noticed this in Magdalena base later but in San Ignacio they said in san ignacio ants Kamen's they had seen whales trying to feed all winter in the lagoons and that was really like a sad thing for the research researchers to see I thought I was there well I saw I definitely saw a calf with money in his mouth but yeah who knows what they were trying to feed and then they also said they saw a lot of skinny adults and I saw some skinny adults I think I have a photo of one too that was like you could see the spine like really clearly and then it was on the northbound migration some of them have been ship strikes actually but it's also like okay well if the whales underweight and like low energy like how easily can it get away from a ship and then some of them have been really really thin gray whales especially the ones in Washington gosh some of those photos from the beach it was like a gray whale skeleton with skin yeah horrible yeah there's a few the San Francisco Bay ones yeah there were some that you can totally tell that the animal is pretty skinny and then there were some that were victims of ship strikes I think that's been confirmed with it I think at least one individual yeah and so basically what sounds like is the leading theory is remember that warm water blob thing we had from like 2013 to 2016 mhm so that's just like added up over the years of like poor foraging success for several feeding seasons in a row and so basically like they're out of gas you know like they've gone like underfed for several seasons and now this is like the last migration but they ran out of energy for so I wonder how many were lost this year yeah like you said yeah that's a good you brought up a good point you know not everything comes ashore so so who knows I know are just the San Francisco Bay count right was like it's like 10 now I think yeah I'm surprised we haven't at any in Monterey Bay it's a big bay for them to land into yeah yeah I've heard of any yeah and it's amazing how sensitive our climate is and the food is - I know when it's a little warm actually the animals will sometimes do a little bit better because there's a little bit less ice but if it's really warm it completely throws off the food chain and then it's it's so sensitive you know did you guys either build my video no it was okay when you were 12 and I was teaching you about like the Earth's crust or something that he's like but if not kids anymore I gotta watch that it's pretty funny to watch it is so awesome Bill Nye now cusses so it's awesome all right I have to watch that and once we're done yeah but I'm just wondering like these whales I mean I guess some of them have that instinct to you know like I know there's the few that I've been hanging out in LA Harbor area they're getting food and obviously we know about that population and over there wiggly island and Washington I can't say it's spelled so weird yeah but that island I've been watching were stopping by for some ghost shrimp and continuing norfolk's I'm wonder what why more whales don't realize they can just come to a coastline and grab food there's there they say it's the same whale every day I don't know that for sure but in Capitola they see a gray whale like every day for the last two months oh yeah I think they call it Cappy now be the Grail yeah so if the mom is teaching them the route to get back home every year you know or when that one has a calf they're taught to go feed it you know above Alaska so if they're not taught to go to Oregon and feed or you know you know I mean well maybe they'll start fishing south and then all these peoples are gonna start you know hanging out yeah other places all summer yeah maybe they used to a long time ago I'm sure they did yeah I wonder wind start yeah weird when it kicks in in their heads like you know I am starving I just need a but oh no I think there's enough day always when I was like first starting other boats there's always like there's not enough nutrients in our mud so it'd be a waste but there's gotta be areas where there's good nutrients right like yeah it's just like how much energy do you waste until you find that spot that's true it's such a long migration - yeah yeah I mean like it may not be that big of an area like you may search a hundred miles and there's only a 10-mile stretch in there somewhere that has enough nutrients to make it worth your while how do you know that yeah there's even some talk about our population going so high right now but that could even lead to you know some food competition maybe or yeah well and I would say like okay the last three seasons before this is like record numbers of births right like the other shoe was gonna drop yeah and after the late 90s El Nino there was a big die-off in like 99 2000 and 2001 yeah like that I'm here the same thing another like anomalous weather event happened there was not as good foraging for several seasons and I'm hearing population counts of up to 27,000 now so yeah yeah so I mean it's hard to say that they're like it's all gonna be fine cuz obviously we don't know if these are like what if these are Russian killer the killer was great well what if these are the western Pacific gray whales that are dying because they've got the longest trip we don't we don't know we can't know the ones coming from Japan yeah so what if the ones from Japan and what have you ever seen agree well in Australia don't think they've ever they probably go straight across on yeah I wonder hemisphere do you think about it those ones that come across from that side they could cross Hawaii maybe no I think they're very coastal is my impression up around yeah they follow the Aleutians across and then go down oh right here Slater's looking at amethyst ring what he's resting so you think they go right into Southeast Alaska and come down yep that's what I think sweet I want to go there yeah these Alaska yeah I'm gonna try to go in August like I'm out of here I'm just talking to Margo target today that I think I want to go in August well that's pretty cool so yeah so great well migration I don't think that the sad news for them is over it may not even be the most happy story next northbound migration mmm it could be something that persists for several years we'll see how could they forage this summer I don't really know but that that's not over that's for sure think about this it was a horrible killer well year last year what if everything's kind of just shifting this like it was just a bad year for everything there were as many sightings of killer wells it also didn't hardly get offshore less wet it was really bad yeah you can't watch us all right fine I'm trying to make science happen and this magazine is you have any killer wise sort P doing your variables so speaking of whales having a hard time they also have declared an unusual mortality event so a um II for the North Atlantic because they've had 96 humpback whale deaths and since January 2016 so sometimes the federal government will declare a ume NOAA will declare one if there's like a high number of whales or any population actually that they manage dying off sometimes they have an explanation sometimes they don't in the North Atlantic a lot of them are ship strike and entanglement but some of them you know they don't have a cause of death for like the whale I saw that was dead out on the ocean vector and they don't have a cause of deaths for her but there was another whale like the next day that washed up in New York and that one was a ship strike so yeah tough stuff tough year for Empire for whales yeah it's hard to be a whale out there we're uh we're making it pretty crazy in the ocean for them making a lot of noise taking a lot of food you know warmer that's the big one yeah yeah and we have no idea how big of a deal it's gonna be oh that's what that bill nye videos about Eric he's like he's like it's gonna get like four degrees hotter and like what was it you know lose entire island nations if it gets four degrees hotter we're gonna lose lots of low lane yeah I'd be okay with it Wow all right guys if you want to write to Kaitlyn Bo box Florida you should make some serious plans about moving how much you start to also reduce your carbon footprint drastically because yeah they've already done some stuff to the dreams there oh you see now we're like we're like nothing's ever like made these sea walls I like take water under or something weird oh really yeah yeah they just think about this in Newport Beach when I was there when I a year a half ago and I moved back for six months they raised a seawall like 30 inches really yeah because all the houses kept flooding no high tide housing I remember about Balboa Island always flooding yeah be walking like in six six inches of water around Baba Island during a you know well there's some beachfront condos and water a that they're gonna have that issue here pretty soon we're just down past El Monte Beach oh yeah that way they're all for sale right there yeah yeah another Rosen's is the coastal erosion from the sand mining in Marina changed the way the beach flows down the beach and so there's less sand and so the that waterfront property is becoming more and more water friends nice yeah a lot of erosion I know Pacific yeah they had those condos or apartments that just washed away you can find yeah still making it still use Nate you know what I went to Jamba Juice today and their straws are no plastic no they're 100% como so I think they're like this corn plasters like it's still a straw well the city ordinance from Monterrey is you sad no Monterrey has one - no I'm saying that was in - oh you guys decide oh ok you're in San City actually yeah so I don't know if it's a anyways he says it's 100% compostable but how long do yeah well in some of those products they only compost if they're in an anaerobic digester so like even if they go in the landfill they don't actually really like break down differently than plastic well I feel like that's don't get stuck in a turtle's nose yeah I could still do a lot - no I felt like it wasn't a great idea either there's some of those products that make me kind of go hmm like they make those edible rings for four cans so it is you know and canned beers I look at like so if the animal is gonna eat that it's safe then it's gonna think other ones that look similar kind of like is this a good idea well maybe their logic is the reverse the anyway it's like Oh something it's like some kibriya and they're probably all the high-end restaurants but it's supposed to be the hundred percent compostable corn plastic that's what they say this but it's still very plastic yeah I have a challenge bring your own straw to Jamba Juice I have thousands right here Oh Margo bought us telescopes drawers are they there on our key chains that's bad yeah we have a bunch except for the funny I forgot to take the cleaner out of this draw the hell is that straw comes with a straw case don't be jealous I am jealous okay so this straw has like a metal straw cleaner that yeah yeah clean - you have to get brushed it well it was inside I was supposed to pull it out and take it out I drink hey man this draw sucks not getting any suction what the heck yeah well they had in the Newport lady down Newport there while watching down there they got hay straws but they flowed out of the cuffs like put it in the governor launches yeah I've seen bamboo I've seen pasta I like your boba straws the other day yeah yes fine okay let me tell you a story though I wash them in the dishwasher yeah and Margo like autumn out she went to look in boat one other was above it I just threw him in this watch you're thinking like I would have for sure cleared the bow bad sure I know I need to get one of those yeah it's cool yeah cause he's still you go through the top you don't use the plastic like cuz that's the way the machine works you like put everything in there and then it how do we we should we should make a don't tell my idea we should make up laws are not plastic I mean like paper top top never backs paper there were some bubble places back in Southern California using like mason jars already like kind of what are those jars this is the canning jar ball ball yeah that's it that's a good idea yeah so bring bring your own materials straw I got bamboo fork and spoon have a little kid nice yeah to me on that oceanic trip they sell the same exact kit but without their symbol on it at like Target I think it's like a bamboo straw for I mean it yeah I take all three of them or something yeah so I tried last time the three of us went to the farmers market I brought my own cup and straw for drink but then I asked for them to not give me a spoon cuz I brought my own spoon for my food there so you said this yeah oh man that corn sounds so good it's only Friday we didn't go this week because what's it called we already went to like two weeks in a row yeah I saw plenty of groceries but that's another idea shop at a farmers market so that your food is not coming on cargo ships or long distances and trucks to get to you we go to the farmers market at least once or twice a month and then you think about our farmers market is they I know people are as concerned about you know getting organic stuff to actually have that section one block is actually designated as the organic speaking of cargo ships dude I'm addicted looking at marine traffic marine traffic calm is the website Slater's talking about and you can watch any ship that's transmitting on this system called a is so it's like a Global Positioning System all large international ships like cargo ships have to have it so they can be attractive on the world so you can actually watch the ships transmitting on a is like at anytime lime on the internet which is pretty cool but also like kind of terrifying because like Slater said their ships everywhere yeah yeah any ship that has the like the device turned on even if it's in Harbor or whatever like it'll it'll transmit so when I drove second operator for overnight cuz you you know down south yeah there's like you would see the Carnival Cruise Lines or the cruise lines out there when Catalina yeah do circles out yeah because it's pitch black what are they gonna do yeah it only takes um like four hours to get somewhere and they have ten hours if they do doing that I'm telling you I kind of making it up but I'm pretty sure they do circles out they do they are they stopped what happens is that remember that one that takes you down the Baja weekend where was that they say they you spend a day in Catalina but you don't actually get off on Kelly you actually just literally spend a whole day there going like three or five knots around Kelly you spend the whole day going around you get off there though sometimes they do but it's like Monterey the same cruise ships some of those cruise ships come from Catalina they hit there then come here yeah come on where'd you go before it's like oh we were in Catalina oh my god because I actually took one too where you didn't get off you just like maybe yeah and you just eat the whole time yeah there's like buffets casinos and yeah now I want to look them up on them Marine marine traffic he's here because you can actually click they're round it's like oh yeah I'll show you their past track yeah yeah that's true they did 17 circles well how about that hermit crab did you see that that had the doll's head for shell and that's the new picture they have you seen the one where he there's a hermit crab that used the bottle cap as its shell yeah that's pretty sad no idea what if it's like chemically doing anything with their bodies no problem it could be leaching yeah it could be leaching chemicals into their body could be yeah yeah because you're not supposed to drink like they actually say not to drink plastic water bottles if they've been in the Sun yeah yeah yeah does it beep beep EVP yeah it's a carcinogen yeah so what what do we do about this plastic thing we were talking about bringing our own utensils um we're making water bottles that are gonna take over the world all right no no drumroll please make that a formal announcement so we're not exactly sure how the purchasing is gonna work yet but we have designed a reusable water bottle a metal water bottle wait we're gonna have to figure it out before this podcast goes live all right yeah cuz it's future I've been following on Instagram will tell you how you can buy them but yeah we're you know if you want to cool you know whale nerds water bottle cuz you like I need one so that's partly why we're making the ocean we're gonna be doing that also World Oceans Day is coming up on June 8th so maybe you can tag along with an event happening in your local area or you can like pledge to tell people about the ocean in your local area you could join our beach cleanup okay so you're doing a beach cleanup again with discovery whale watch and we're gonna have some collaborators Monterey Bay kayaks Portola Hotel Monterey County Visitors Bureau well there's podcast is now cool yeah yeah who else we can snag should we make a website for this or why oh I think Seafood Watch is gonna give us some swag to I don't know if they're gonna come but they're gonna give us some likes oh maybe we'll have these water bottles because if they go better hustle yeah well we have to order them because well they'll already be ordered by that time yeah yeah cool sweet so if you're in the Monterey area we're gonna be doing beach cleanup from 11:30 to 1:30 domani beach next to Wharf 2 and there is a paddle out with Monterey Bay kayaks from 9 to 11 so after the paddle out you can do that and I think they're doing a discounted kayak rental for it it's like five dollars off so you can paddle out with everybody and then after the paddle out we're cleaning the beach in the same spot I'm curious to see how much sure how much trash we get because last time I feel like we didn't get there wasn't that much not compared to the winter one that's for sure no but after we've had some wind this whole week it's been raining again so it's gonna push more stuff towards the beach yeah and then starting to get busy too so it'll be a lot of more beach users and so there probably be trash left behind by them I want to buy a metal detector make money and fix the world leaders gonna find a bunch of bicycle parts like last time we almost had a little bike did I tell you about the woman who emailed me who like did her own version of the beach cleanup before us because she couldn't make our time what she liked I found a lot of Bike Barn I think I found like part of a bike tire Peverley yeah and I was like I emailed her back and I was like we found the rest of the bike later yeah and a part of the brake that's hard I don't know if someone like lost their bike overboard on their boat or they got mad yeah it's kind of bizarre oh I bet there's people that are like there's people are traveling says they're probably just a can tossed it off or it fell off or it fell off do you guys see that video of that it's it's probably an old video but if someone just dumping plastic and or dumping a trash can in the ocean I've seen that particular one but yeah I've seen thanks I know that there's so many boats that do that in our ocean as well like that boats that go offshore I'm not gonna say yeah I mean 80% of the trash comes from the land but 20% does come from dumping out that's see that's how people used to think and unfortunately or some people still think that way that the ocean is just some big old me you know just could take anything you know even just around our immediate area right here in the bay they look at all the dumps that's why we get some of the best sea glass ever here yeah so yeah it's kind of funny how people just some people still think that way yeah so I'm also kind of keen on this plastic topic right now because I went to the Audubon Society meeting Audubon like cars fast highway night and it was about this woman who did a six-week bird count for albatross on Midway Atoll and man oh man do they get some interesting Beach things she said during their orientation she's like oh yeah the like the coordinator was like I need a laundry basket to do laundry you just walk down to the beach you'll find one and she was like no kidding you could go find a laundry basket almost every day of the six weeks I was there that's scary I'm like lots of plastic lighters and like those you know like those big gray like trays that they use on fishing boats like sort the catch beating stuff they almost look like those same bins you use at TSA yeah she said that you have a whole bunch like they found a whole bunch of those they found loads of fishing net and floats oh yeah it's rough somewhere there's lots of styrofoam floats she said there were several Birds sitting on a float thinking it was an egg practicing or some thought that was the egg how sad where's she County albatross yeah dude bro did you guys see okay so the owner of oceanic sighted emailed me this morning and he said did you guys see this albatross well I clicked the article 17 year old black-footed albatross tagged and the French frigate Shoals was seen here like six it just sat right yeah there's been a lot lately and I was like you mean they have a green tag on the foot so I'm taking photos of all those cuz maybe we could have been one of those yes show me - if you do get a photo of a banded bird anywhere what is it US Fish and Wildlife yes G s us yes maybe yeah maybe that's what it is you can submit the band ID and a photo and they'll they'll get back to you and tell you where the birds from or maybe the or maybe it's bbl the bird it's funny you mention that because I just pulled up this picture is that I wonder that's one of those trains you're talking about it's like bunch of lighters and suppose they also have the bigger big ones but yeah they said they would like have a little competition of like who can find the most unique item every day I think I'll send you a t-shirt I mean it's just like when you catch a fish and you have inside this tag another tag if like for hunters to those in the like band back to them if they like submit it yeah yeah they like - 17 years old yeah that's pretty wisdom is 68 and she had a chicken I don't want to weigh the wild one that's like the oldest banded bird ever is like his wisdom at least now etosha 68 years old and she had a chick this year this year yeah Wow hey that was as old as bird she's cool yeah did you know fun fact there's one pair of short-tailed albatross on Midway Atoll they normally greet in Japan just one and they look very very similar to black chick last year or the year before they had a black-footed albatross chick they look very very similar right when they're babies but like they look like I don't know they have a very pink bill and ultra and then they have like a blue tip on the end of the bill and then they're more white they think they get like a red uh yellow on their head let me hop yes when you look very similar when I last oh no when they're babies they do it yeah but yeah that's the big span but how many like pretty much every bird sea bird out there has plastic right they kind of figured out that yes at five hundred percent of the city shearwaters that were sampled the past year I don't know where they sampled them at they must been New Zealand where they nest well they all have plastic did they bring up the fact there was a someone's was saying that plastic breaking down even though you know we know it's a slow breakdown it actually emits like an odor that's yes almost enticing to these birds yeah so it actually it attracts like this other plankton to settle on it and then that plankton smells like decomposing food so the birds think it's food cuz it smells like food uh-huh yeah so then they end up eating it even though it's plastic which is pretty sad cuz you take both never I mean we're not yeah yeah well we're never gonna be able to change that right yeah I mean this is the new like paradigm right it's like how what do we do is is really the question and then our whales and dolphins you've mentioned how like pretty much every bird has plastic what compacts one lunch feeding this one figure was it fifty six percent yeah whales and dolphins and I can't read this tiny writing but there's a source for this but yeah I think this well came from WWF but I'm not sure what their source was but yeah I don't know how they did their survey of a fifty six percent but Slater's right you know socially a hundred percent but yeah exactly especially around here coastal you know it's like almost guaranteed to get microplastic hundreds of gallons of water in one go you know even a blue you know yeah it's like guaranteeing a pound of Gary gonna go gallons or more and then there's animals like you know beaked whales and sperm whales that target gelatinous things and then get plastic sheeting and bags confused for their food that's happened a lot a lot of year chewing on I mean it they just swallow it if they can suck it down then they just will you know they can't tell what it is by the way whales drink water I mean salt water they have to there's no way they can send all that water out no they probably do and the way that they deal with that because their food is also very salty is they have these kidneys that were like they're like a hundred kidneys in one they're like really reticulated and so they can extract the salt that like a way higher rate than ours can so they're just like they're pretty cool yeah just because dudes like if you actually think about it it's like you can't blow it out and then you know because I don't think their tongue is as dexterous as other mammals like they can't like lick their baleen or anything I don't think yeah and I thought they and that's what people say a lot of natural say like oh they lick it up and then spin to a little ball on twelve-hour they just swallow it down I've been looking at the Goldberg in lab actually was kind of trying to figure that out like what does the tongue do when a whales lunge feeding and it like moves backwards into their throat like out of their buccal cavity basically out of their throat please because otherwise would be in the way of all that expansion yeah the buccal cavity back down into the throat out of the way so it's like there's no way they could be like licking the flick in their baleen right whales on the other hand might be able to lick their Bailey is their tongue is like in place while they're like just skin feeding mm-hmm so maybe they can just like brush it a little bit have you guys ever gone up to that over in Sausalito marine mammal they got this display that's in the courtyard it's kind of sad they call it's good the car looks like a ghost but it's all made out of netting I see 450 pounds of net pulled out from the inside sperm inside of a sperm whale yeah it's a sperm whale that washed up north of them it's just it's just hard it sucks that these animals are ingesting this they've truly pulled that out of one for a while inside well yeah I mean there was a what were you doing just showering down on it yeah that's what I'm thinking you know we know it was a 200 million foot squid yeah yeah I don't know that's a lot unless there's a bunch of different ones that we're all thrown off you know maybe there are different colors aren't they it's a green and red yeah there's a lot of the netting was like this gray color because the stomach acids just kind of wore off some of the dye or coloring on some of the netting but yeah the gray stuff they say was from I mean some animal um some of those news stories from earlier this year and last year of the sperm whales with the plastic bags and cheating some of those were like over 200 pounds worth of pasta yeah and there's that one I know they have that display at Seattle Aquarium is like what 80 pounds of like plastic bag for a full-term a young gray whale that's how much they can ingest yeah you know another good point I mean this is also kind of circling back to whale migration but they're talking about the City shearwaters the average percentage of their body mass that was plastic was 15 percent these birds fly 44 thousand miles a year yeah carrying that like unnecessary weight because they can't digest sound right no and oftentimes they like can't get it out of their stomach again either so the joke that we say how they can't get off the water cuz they're so full not so full of plastic now and I don't want to see that joke I know you know how we're always like a comma they can't get off the water to the commerce King well they lose their feathers though they do go flightless yeah the commoners do that's so silly I'm a bird I'm gonna lose my feathers well a lot of birds molt like one or two primary feathers at a time and then it takes three to five years to molt but the mers just molt all their primary feathers at once and it only takes a few months they can get off a little bit kinda yeah for like two months depends on the birds are sick some have what they call dramatic molt it's all at once like penguins will go through when they know they're about to hit multi actually load up on food yeah they know not to swim not to see to get they don't want to eat right like the ones that they have at the re-bake room get cranky and don't want to get before it yeah but before it they they load up before demo do they see well their molt they molt they're cranky so they they still eat sort of but not really they said they don't eat a whole lot when they're molting but they can do that right they can just not eat for a while yeah they they pass they pack it on they get ready like a bear before harbin a hibernation or me before winter for long winters now what for summer whatever you can hear around that's true good it's middle of May we're having rainstorm she is my don't see hibernates during most of our podcast they see is my dog and she is not a down sleeping shows how much she cares she doesn't even like whales no she hates him she's in killer whales that she has at least you didn't bark at was like a lot of dogs we see how at sea bark at the whales yeah it really just like one or two dogs in particular about know what no we saw well during a predation there was a another dog barking out there it was going wild for the night it was oh yeah yeah that's kind of funny but Shh one of the best passenger dogs we ever had at Discovery was our first summer is this big golden retriever and he's just like looking on the back of the survey and he watching all the sea lions like happiest conveyed money hello relatives my friends yeah so what else you know oh I know something what I saw that killer well iceberg Japan yeah it's funny cuz I've googled that well before oh good I was like I really would not look for this but it's not like it's possible it's usually seen in Russia all right it was seen in Russia and she doesn't like yeah the last time before Japan was Russia I think yeah I think he was like 2010 so icebergs a male killer well that is either leucistic or albino do they have pictures of it I I don't know it's like yellow yeah the last pictures from Hokkaido were really far away but there was comes closer ones from Russia yeah you know I patched in saddle patch it's just like different shades of light colored skin it's the total trip how cool though yeah I would freak out yeah you would you would not know what to do with yourself you imagine seeing that you jump in the ocean with your video from the town from the drone Oh like that pod like it's like all black with little heart-shaped saddles and then boom this white one with the white now that would be insane so interesting little like political issue too so as cited in North Japan and they couldn't keep following the whales because it went outside of their territorial sea and the way that the politics work up there they couldn't stay with the will and the seems like iceberg is still kind of like our little buddy Casper to the white Rizzo yeah they're still like there's still a debate whether it's albinism or this ISM so and the whales lived a long time because his dorsal fin is really big and really large adult want to say they're saying they're saying it's their guess was like 15 years old but it's health issue yeah you know he's mature obviously so it's like most animals with those type of conditions usually have other conditions that don't make them live that long so I mean I guess he's you know don't worry about him being picked off by another predator and we got like nigga Liu - it's like wow how old are you and like how'd you how you survived us so you know yeah it's good to see these animals doing well and showing up year after year such a wild place those two if I could see either one of those I bet make it would be a lot easier than iceberg yeah I think they see animals every year every other year or something yeah they've seen on more than once yeah I know people that on the Gold Coast I know people that have photos of them Lisa Lisa Lisa has photos Oh does she oh yeah she does - oh wow John photos em - yeah okay let's go I know people swim with them what yeah good in unison Eric I'm pretty sure someone's never though that's awesome so make it loose a humpback whale a southern hemisphere humpback whale boom who's that Craig Barry yeah my life Wow not just a photograph but human not just as a photographer but human yeah in Tonga I'm pretty sure oh really well yeah whoa wait for me as I hit the Barrier Reef / - I have no such fear I may be no he's comparing all the different places he's yeah maybe not but wow you know he's from Australia so it's probably Australia yeah I'm Joey that's crazy yes - we're really trying to one-up our whale experiences we've seen like some of those incredible things on earth how do we top it we're running out of the gas here I want to see bowhead whales I think I don't know why that's a big one for me bowhead whales I want to see him yeah I don't know why after teen right whales I still want to see bowhead whales because they're like the master of that style looking whale yeah their boss they don't migrate they just have babies in frozen water they don't care that's crazy so explain that why can they do that but other ones can I guess they're just born I think the other ones can but they're like yeah let's go to the tropics don't occasion yeah so bowhead whales they just be warned with a thicker blubber layer and they do move because at the ACS meeting they talked about this what's her name Katie Katie for sure move oh good girl who did the talking right Wales no she did bowhead whales with the hydrophone and member they'd like they put this hydrofoil in an area where they're like and we don't really think both had whales go here but we want to be sure so they expected like one or two detections and all winter at the bowhead whales we're singing over this hydrophone like three months singing my humpbacks not that doesn't sound like humpbacks but yeah singing like associated with breeding so they were like holy cow like and all the things we've started to learn about the ocean and you're thinking it's becoming like a less of a mysterious place here it is putting this like hydrophone in a one-off place and all the sudden they unlocked where the bowhead whales go in the winter we're gonna have to go to North Eastern I mean I'll do it these ships are not cheap no their minimum like six thousand I'm sorry that's like just that trip but then like 2004 the flight yeah two days you got a hotel's like it's crazy depending on where you're from unless you're from Greenland and you just go right there yeah I guess he's moved to Greenland for years what Nova Scotia what they don't have a boys there no but you'd be closer sure we're like Canada yeah Nova Scotia's in Canada oh yeah and that's how I man I like the North part like just like Churchill okay yeah that's where the blue I mean like way up yeah miss Nova Scotia's not that far out right all right no it's like right on the US border yeah they say cuz you can go people go fishing with the Bay of Fundy on once part is us and then another previous Canada speaking of which the right whales are like peace now to Cape Cod Bay so I like just made it oh man time they're starting to be sighted in the Gulf of st. Lawrence I was hoping they would still be there when I got there no you didn't go in time to be right on it man oh we're almost there you are so full of it yeah wait if we go to the summer southern hemisphere are they left well that's actually someone asks that question how do whales get their name so the right whale got its name because though it was the right whale to kill I think yeah I think we talked about this there's very robust and rotund tell them about the left whales it's not a thing I just made that up how about we go see we've talked about this before too but I really want to go I was googling pictures on the boat the other day of this southern right well dolphins oh yes man dies cool like they're pretty much it there there white goes way more uh yeah take half black half white basically great it's pretty cool yeah they have a lot of cool dolphins in the side of the ocean they have the congressman's dolphin and the hourglass dolphin a lot more white on all the southern hemisphere yeah it's really weird and wonder why yeah right whales are like that cuz the water is clear so they're like sighs why is it give me bigger - yeah bigger than even the humpbacks whoa there's any blues right now that are living that are her feet if there is I hope they hide forever ready why guys I don't want them to get hurt you can still see them do you think I've seen a blue at 70 feet yes I think you have I think you've seen a blue well that's like 85 feet yeah that for sure there are video I have one it's next to the yeah a really cool lunch meeting what video that is a big will yeah but there's one in Newport Beach yeah I'm pretty sure it was its way big it was way bigger than the ocean Explorer which is like I want to say it's like 68 feet yeah 66 so yeah I know and there's whales that are bigger than the Western pride which is like 77 feet so yeah yeah I've definitely seen blue whales have been pushing like 85 90 feet is that crazy mm-hmm I want to see one that's 110 for sure I do that's like too big that's scary to say yeah like okay one time we had like 50 to 75 blue whales in like a two mile radius in monterey bay up north and it was honestly it's kind of scary to have that many huge animals all like one more memorable days all right so I posted today yeah okay well people are like ones best time I we used to say like July August down south but like yeah I feel like August September is a better time so what I tell people is made July through October is the best but they can't show up earlier and they have stayed later yeah like we totally saw they saw one like a couple days ago or a week ago yeah I say that that day we keep on talking about wasn't November I think it was yeah sometimes they just stay late like the 50 to 75 we had in 2016 that was in May stay late we don't even know where they freaking go that's also true so it's like they could just be offshore where all this would be like dude this was the plan all along you guys are dumb I think they're constantly eating so they gotta keep on moving you know ease dobby's we also obviously used to think like oh when they go to the breeding grounds they don't eat but they eat they have to they're always here because they're Elza eat down there anyways yeah that's why they go that's why they think they go to the Costa Rica dome area is because that's a small upwelling zones yeah there is krill there so that's one misconception with blue elza's yeah they don't stop eating there sighs for Migration while fasting and it's like grey whale and humpback whale sighs and right whale size but if you're smaller than that like a minke whale you eat all the time and if you're bigger than that like a fin whale you also eat all the time I see you're determined to be famous you would be famous more famous than the shark the killer whale eating the shark oh yeah are you ready I don't know if you think about it that's pretty one it's not that crazy actually you have enough time they've already seen it I mean it wasn't world first but it was like still pretty cool it's not world first I don't know was it some people were trying to say it was I don't know if it was if there's like I don't know there's fake Photoshop killer of eating eating a great white no because they want the raisin yeah no it's been seen before but in California for sure at first well then they had him kill a blue shark down literally two days later or something yeah but they just got the tail end of it it was like they barely saw it so yeah yeah it's still really cool yeah we've seen some cool stuff yeah I need more whales you gotta do what Gary Vee says it's all about the gratitude dude oh I'm grateful good but I need more it's not greedy when you okay it's like saying like I don't even know I want to travel it's like I want to see more whales so much you ask what we want to see whales all around the world um what do you know Eric did you do anything fun mmm we were barely on the water this weekend feels like yeah the waters but when we were out you know I think me and Slayer talked about this there's noir tonight Nora right well dolphins did last few days it's been nuts it's just we see him usually I don't know once a month I think we've seen him what every other day at least almost out in today I just crazy how many we've been seeing all son no no it's just there it's their year I won't beg you to see them this 2019 the year of the northern right whale about 19019 did you hear from lack of so tomorrow we're going in the morning yeah it's gonna be rainy though yeah do do the whales mind getting wet that's a question again someone actually wrote this is this is a question we actually get in the office people depending on my mood depending on my mood I usually tell them they don't like water down their blowholes I just usually tell people well the whales live in water so they're already wet so they don't mind or if I do have if I'm not having a bad day Oh sometimes to say they don't like it just walk away no I don't do that don't ask Eric any questions like that you want some major sass what time of the whales but a lot of people actually do really wonder if like weather affects we're watching because weather does affect other wildlife watching like on land but for whales I mean they you know there's there's stuff with however the oceans gonna be that day so they usually just keep carrying on with whatever they were doing why just stay down longer yeah sometimes but even like sometimes when it's windy we see them breach more so I don't think they care and by the way they 1000% I'm a scientist listen to me they get water in their blowholes just like they drink it they don't care just a little bit goes in there a little bit they probably have some like wet lung system that we don't know about okay they're amphibian man it's like okay so do your making if you are gonna believe you I'm a jar a little chart pointy little lungs wet long don't you think they get some water that's a little bit they did for sure right not enough to drown it might cost about one all right I'm gonna swab one how dude you're gonna try and like stuff is gonna be cotton swab swab dip a q-tip in there blow yeah that sounds really risky I can do it your drones gonna get blown like off course yeah sure no yeah dude you know the crazies I inhale as you can hear there and over like that's my favorite sound is hearing I love that blue or fin whales yeah that's why I do my no talking when the whales up cuz that's the thing I want to hear the most yeah all right well we covered some sad topics yep and we all want to see more whales pretty much that's always gonna be art it was really windy this week hopefully um next week calm down but I think it's really gonna go into next week here it's been windy actually up and down the coast that was almost running away down south to visit our friends and Adam from Santa Barbara says it's windy or by using new ports it is windy so that Eric you went looking for like mushrooms and newts or what elements elements now Anders yeah and then I went hiking and I found wild strawberries should eat one I wanted to keep it there for the animals it was really small who eat strawberries animals anything bears bears mm-hmm birds squirrels by the way are there any grizzly bears in California and there's none laughs they're all girly yeah that's a fun word for you extirpated we in fact you know right down the street in front of City Hall they got those statues in honor of the California grizzly I couldn't even grizzly from another state that just wandered in but yeah the California grizzly bear was extirpated I'm telling you there's one time when big zoo didn't could be spotted by now yes yeah you know it's weird I want to say I think it's the Pacific Grove Museum that actually has I stuffed one this doll or something of one of the last Grizzlies yeah the PG Museum well they should reintroduce him the ranchers might come out to you I'm down for what wolves have already technically kind of come back well let's go look for him okay see me hard to find him well look on our way up all right you guys we're now talking about Leena animals probably in his podcast thanks so much for listening hopefully we have some more exciting stuff soon yeah if not mark your calendars June 8th World Oceans Day do something for the ocean that day we're gonna remind you every podcast until June 8th and maybe afterwards probably only like two more vodka or one more podcast yeah all right get ready make sure you guys follow us on instagram at whale nerds if you don't already and thanks so much for listening thank you thanks everyone and keep on sending us questions and topics they'll be much appreciated thanks for listening

hello everyone and welcome back to the wilderness podcast this is episode number 24 23 I'm sorry no no keep on going all right so this is episode number 23 my name is Slater and I'm here with Eric and Katelyn hello everyone hi and we are three days late but it's in good reason yeah we missed you no and that's not why because we're all saying cool oh we're all busy and I was seeing not cool stuff but you guys were all right so Josh we have a few things to talk about first Eric saw something really cool last week and he's gonna talk about that and then Kailyn was in the office I did see one cool thing left oh yeah Caitlyn has something to talk about and then I'll talk about what I did but first we'll hear from Eric and his big dolphins okay yeah everyone so yeah we all been kind of busy and traveling around but yeah I got to see Barrett's beat whales again and if you don't know what those are they are a whale that does have the potential of staying down there longest I've ever recorded was close to two hours and their dive tie depth can be close to two miles so those animals when you see him come up just happened to be surfacing and coming up for a breath and luckily the pod we saw was 24 animals and they're all lined up in the Echelon formation so it was pretty cool to see and they were pretty big they can get up close too close to you know 40 feet usually about you know 37 35 feet or so or the bigger ones so really impressive sighting really rare sighting for some of us as I've been a water for quite a while and that was only sighting number two for me question question how many bowls they have one blowhole because in order to do well yeah why are they dolphins they're b12 because they're because people probably to understand why they're not they dolphins honestly beaked whales is like a super appropriate name for them because of the shape of their head so like especially Baird's they really live true to that beaked whale name it's like a giant doll it's way too big of a dolphin to be a whale so it's kind it's way too big of a dolphin whale to be a dolphin gosh I'm messing this up but it has a very unusual head and snout that looks like a beet it's kind of like why porpoises are dolphins yes kind of yeah different in they've teeth general the heads sometimes different but not a few exceptions difference in the number of vertebrae and then general body size and then the layout of the teeth yeah they do look very big dolphins oh they do maybe you kind of do in fact there is another b-12 bottlenose dolphin yeah and if we're confusing ourselves or bottlenose whale yeah Bono's well you can yeah I think yeah just see what yeah they saw something down there and I think Judith Scott's on northern bottlenose whales in Iceland a few years ago so the beaked whales you saw they have died like the yellow diatoms on a reserve you know what's funny is you know what's funny is this time the first time I saw them they did have that kind of a brownish scratched-up look to him a little bit of yellow this time you seen a little bit darker I'm not because I'm not sure because of the overcast because it didn't notice that one one of them breached oh yeah one of them breached it did look it was almost like a it almost look like a brown Rizzo a lot of scratches on it but it was brown so the lighting might have thrown me off a little bit but the first time yeah was there kind of brown and scratched up but this time it was very overcast when we got three good looks we got lucky because they stayed fairly close to this general area so they scratched up kind of like Rizzo's like thanks from each other and from squid probably yeah they definitely scratch each other those big long like parallel lines you'll see down there body those are from each other yeah especially the males doing this in pitch black yeah like they're just raking each other down there they say the males have a lot more than the females yeah they have teeth sticking up like you know we weren't close enough to see that I know some species of b12 it's very clear especially on males and stuff like that the to sri aliy come out but for these i didn't see any and my photos at least i don't know if it bears it's very prominent beards or cuvees I don't think it's very prompt okay yeah yeah which ones do do show it really well yeah oh there's one that I get all the rest rap tooth yeah it's like I think even though maybe the are knocks which is they used to think we're bears on the other side yeah slightly looks like a small over yeah yeah yeah the quite a few of them do actually have that yeah but yeah be quails guys it's still there so mysterious which which is the one they only know because of a stranding there's several actually especially if you have a COAG orders wheels of the world poster yeah that one includes a lot of species that were not previously recognized in other drawings yes so these animals live in very deep water when your ears are very lucky to see them cuz they just come up for a breath and like I just said some of them yeah are only known because of a specimen that washed up on shore never been seen alive I don't know if anyone's seen that I think you can see like this the stein injures beaked whale or something in Monterey as well it's been seen stranded several times along the shores but I don't know if there's ever been a live sighting in California yeah beaked whales maybe that are not speak too well thing happened like last year yeah like for sure there's not a baleen whale has a machine but I don't think so I mean other than maybe just some more detailed like speciation of like yeah you know like the O'Mara's well they used to think it was a say what it's a different way so really quickly to add this and I know we want to quickly talk about your guys's experience the last few days but speaking of whales and species did you hear about this the the pilot whale shortman oh I just read that alright they have this there's a square faced one exactly I don't never there was it was like psycho or not yeah give him some Japanese yeah not weird but just I don't know how to I wonder if false killer whales will get that same thing because you know how you hear some people are like oh yeah this sometimes we see them kill dolphins and then today I only see them hunt fish I wonder if that'll happen yeah I think the populations probably all do different things but they could become ecotypes or something as well kind of like yeah yeah so what Slater said yeah the papers basically states they've always noticed that some of these short-finned pilot heads have more of a rounded head some have a blocky head and then some we finally went into the DNA and going okay you're right it is a you know subspecies and everything names yeah but there's a Woods Hole paper that's what they're saying that the Japanese whalers always always know this a difference that no one actually took this yeah there is if you went yet obvious difference yeah yeah ones like I've seen short-finned pilot whales yeah and it's totally that bull you know that Iqbal said yeah these ones are like a blunt like it's kind of like that but it's exposed yeah but they are it seems like it's only there's like the northern part of the Japan's he's one of them and for us I want to say it's even the northern North East Pacific we're seeing one of them so I got real look at the range map yeah it's a tiny area yeah yeah it's away from our Civic yeah so it's pretty decent you must be offshore like fishing trolls yeah between Hawaii not even Hawaii I take it further I think it's way south that's one of those things that's always been in front of us and finally someone just took the time like even I was even towing was it you guys I was telling about even like Giant Pacific octopus not to go off whale oxidation but yeah Giant Pacific octopus that the fishermen I always notice there's one that comes up very smooth and there's one that comes up like more of a rougher texture even though they can change it but once consistently like that and they finally realized someone put some thought into this and it turns out there is two different yeah two different ones out there so I think probably there'd be more discoveries like that with cetaceans yeah but I don't know if it's like something that's like totally never been documented before I think it's more like getting more detailed information just finally took the time and like I'm gonna look into this go for it the day I saw the beaked whales I woke up and I told myself I don't feel like watching Margaret my wife was just like well then just don't go today like you've been every day I think even called me the night before that's I was expecting you and so I didn't go and then I saw her air checked in with some beaked whales and I was like Eric that's his post when everybody checks in with him yep he never just posted a photo leave me in suspense Percy lets everyone know I call them he said I was pretending to listen when I was a kid I yeah he's pretty sure is that guys okay later about those it called me as well and I said Eric's probably crying on the boat first off second off that's the thing with whale watching right like at some point as a human being you have to rest and you took the day to rest and like you just never know when it's gonna happen cuz you could have totally gone and nothing would have happened yeah I mean like you would have been exhausted and so you know how can you know how can you know something yeah I always have that thought is like I need to stay off the water at least one day and I was like it's gonna be a killer whale day or something there's some spirit in Margo's like no you need to go because what if like yeah all of April what if I went every see me we can play that what-if game for the end of time in Monterey Bay like you know constantly have things like that happen yeah it's really cool I tried to stay off the water today and then just taking my morning walk yeah we've always thought well we did it we actually Danny called it out yeah boats past it and then we were at least we saw it hmm yeah they just blew right past well yeah our other boat kept going yeah I was called hey how was Korea back with the radio yeah even two minutes oh well yeah he's right in front of the Hopkins that was right about there well the day after your beached whales uh-huh I went of course oh yeah here we go I'll get a knock second day we had I think like just some humpbacks it was very casual day and then we had white-sided dolphins and they thought they saw some northern right whale dolphins and then we were leaving those and headed back towards like the point from the canyon and we ran into a pot of killer whales oh that's right yeah me too yeah so it's funny cuz that night before had just decided that I wanted to go to San Juan Islands cuz I was seeing all of Sara's photos of like backflipping killer whales all week long like there was fun that's funny I saw one photo of this like sunset bridge and it actually ended up being from like a year ago I asked the guy when I got there I know he showed me the sunset breach boat and he was like twitching you guys so I booked a plane ticket up there and then the next morning we see killer whales as if saying like you could have just saw yeah but there's some that they're not seeing very often here you had Ricky had Richie yeah yeah there was others yeah so he put it as Oct 3 8 but what's the other catalog number doesn't even know I have it it's not see a 38 is it I think it's 58 okay they aren't they aren't cited very often you seen that what you've heard the number mm-hmm yeah so anyways we saw the killer whales which was really cool yeah it was two males which one was Richie and then three females so yeah that was exciting nice see a 177 oh I don't think I've ever seen them in it which is Oct 29 and then see a 54 huh yeah interesting yeah 54 yeah I always call that you get those whales that no one's seen for years yeah 54 was one of the male's no it's a female okay so yeah we saw the killer whales and then I left to San Juan Island and I took a freaking plane a bus and then a ferry and then I got I literally got in like 45 minutes for the 5:30 whale watch I drop my stuff I was like I got a ride up to my hotel I don't actually I didn't put in my hotel yeah I just put it in the office and then went on the boat Thanks and we had a CA and I'm sorry I ca t we had the TTC five B and C's and the t's 75 B and C's no that's pretty cool yeah so but not even an hour on the water and we had a bunch of eight killer whales so that was awesome covered a lot of miles there yeah we and we went to so when Jeff was down here at the I don't know if he talked about on our podcast but he was talking about active pass and he said that's where the the residents usually get breach oh yeah yeah well we ended up going I got to see active pass we went in there I wonder there multiple times on this trip yeah and the whales went right in there and then they ended up flipping around and going right back out and you have traveling and then the next day we they were out of they were no one saw them the next day but then they saw the t46 bees which is the family that has the gray Orca yeah and we got to see it for three trips in a row C Locker yeah super cool and then we taught on all the trip the next day but you had to go really far right yeah so the all-day trip we left at 10:00 a.m. and then we drove four straight to it for two hours straight all the way up north in Canada to a place called in a 9 mo and we ended up going 10 miles past that with the killer whales dang time factor that boat go how fast can it go yeah I mean I heard it's really fast but yeah there yep but yeah so that was I mean the background in the islands that you're passing there mm-hmm it's just unreal oh yeah you know your backdrops I saw like it's just black house isn't so much greenery yeah yeah there's lighthouses I like lighthouses that's good here's our pretty to the blue yeah they're like checkers well then you got a nice shot of whales with trees in the background that's pretty neat yeah I want to go back he's so in love with the photos well I just did the backgrounds like you could put anything in front of those background you know yeah yeah which we did see humpbacks I didn't post any pictures of we did have a humpback lined up with Mount Baker did they stay with the humpbacks a lot longer than we do yeah no I kind of liked when you were here that first time in my no I was cool the humpback was awesome we actually were you know how you like the humpback goes down you all start chatting uh-huh and then you know it's like you know three or four hundred yards away or something yeah and you're just talking talking and it ends up right next yeah yeah like 15 feet off the bow you get all startled yeah yeah to us twice and both times I don't think anyone to photo of it never get friendlies here like we do yeah I think they do every once in a while but they don't have as many whales so I feel like they're they like else just funny I was talking to another captain across boats we were texting I saw my friend up there uh-huh and he was like these humpbacks are boring like he just got back from Hawaii yeah so he's like but I think it's also due to the numbers like we have tons of numbers in the bay so I think they're like more interactive with yeah probably you know Peck slapping and like communicating other ways and just vocalizing yeah and that's why they seem boring there because there's like two whales and all of you know getting flu shots no they didn't flute like they've won flipped and it was like it barely put it up you know yeah okay so shallow yeah I don't think I don't think it was 300 feet where we were at so I don't think had anything I think it just they fluked it just wasn't enough to get an ID yeah was going towards us so okay yeah yeah oh well one of the whales was I know is I think was Raptor that's a Kona yeah they have named it they know every single one of theirs well yeah cousin I think there's like they have like 400 gotta log that day yeah so they said 10 years ago they didn't even have humpbacks they were what's the word for regionally extinct yeah yeah yeah I mean 10 years ago here we barely had any right and I think you know Ted does a really good job of talking about that how this is like a rediscovery of habitat for these California humpback whales so you can do anything like what is this place I've never been in there I'm just I'm just hoping this is a place that they're you know gonna be staying here in Monterey with the canyon and stuff like that you know most places sometimes it's just just happen to be right current right temperature for a while but here I mean we got that can so hopefully I think they're gonna stay I mean they wailed here yeah there was three whaling stations within like 60 miles of each other here he just took decades to yeah yeah me discovering repopulate it's the same thing with the Southern California Bight I think that's another place where it some years may be better than others but there will always be whales out there yeah yeah oh it's a cool fact that I learned so that this whale wasn't actually in the pod of whales I was also the t46 bees know the t46 be her mother t46 she has she's with her own like pod at her offspring that she stays with but she was captured she was the last live capture in 1976 and she was let go and because she was like oh there's now 20 more yeah between her children and her grandchildren isn't that cool yeah what was the year did that you remember the year that that happened she liked to go yeah she was cat no she was they were at she was like live capture and then like I think they let her there was because there was back then there was they had to be between a certain size yeah so she might have been lucky enough to not be in there yeah or they wanted the you know the mail or whatever it was yeah or they ended up letting them all go they actually talked about that capture in the book orcas how he came to know and love the apex predator yeah so that book by Jason Colby is I might like ten hours I don't read but I listen I'm telling you if you just want to hear some sad stuff listen to that but it's like I want everyone to listen to it because some of the stuff I mean all of this stuff I learn in there is I have no idea that much craziness was going on up in you read the part about the 50 cals yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah I actually saw the where they're at that's where the humpbacked I want to show you next to rock huh the it's still there there's a well there's a little Museum right there it's a gun isn't there anymore obviously but it's little weird I didn't interesting like yeah so they had these 50 caliber like the machine guns you know was mounted to the side of the cliff where they could shoot at killer Wells if they wanted to but they I guess they ended up never doing it but people did shoot at killer Wells they had bullets and tons of killer whales who are we talking to or was it a lecture someone in Alaska has seen humpback whales was like perfect like piercings oh and maybe it was our interview with Eva it looks like a perfect circle missing out of their fluke and they think it's already this year that a perfect circle on a trip missing from it yeah I've even seen Blues of like perfect yeah holes to have to be from that but yeah in Alaska Eva seem to have a source that was like yeah we still have animals old enough to remember when we were idiots oh for sure oh yeah it's awesome I mean yeah well I didn't see that one but that's not her family yeah what she could have told them yeah I mean they have structured language that is sophisticated enough to definitely pass down that kind of information but the Jay I mean all of the the whole pot was and never saw them on right so you did see what whales in in a bay yeah oh like a net it off yeah it's like different like the beginning of Free Willy it's true other than the beginning of Free Willy over there I'm on that it in there yes that's what they did yeah yeah exactly like that oh I thought they just used captive animals it is Metis I'm off to film them oh you mean family the footage in the movie is like doctored or something yeah that's all like electronic little things yeah yeah yeah what are we talking about before that though uh you saw humpback whales you saw them saying that the offspring yeah about that capture in the book in the book yeah yeah which is crazy what I thought was crazy that's four years after the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972 which they were SeaWorld was still getting permits to capture killer whale I think well into the 80s yeah I want to say oh yeah this was the last war the last one there was in 76 but yeah Washington stopped it pretty soon then they went to Iceland to get their killer whales yeah yeah I'm sure they get him from where and that's where Keiko came from he was Icelandic killer whale yeah so yeah that's why they wanted to put him in it seep in in Iceland huh yeah yeah yeah I said he was he was originally he was at a facility in Mexico and then the Oregon Coast Aquarium said they would take him yeah cuz he was like really sick he had like really bad skin that could be another podcast yeah there's a lot of stories though about that yeah I don't know the name of that disease I can pull it up and maybe you can try to say the words Caitlyn is worried so is that great killer well I saw oh we don't they don't know if it's leucistic or it has C age which is like some big words altogether look it up for me but there was another whale that was born in 2000 shoot 2009 or 7 I came positive on it and it was the same thing but it ended up dying like only within a couple months yeah so this one's obviously lasted longer than that one yeah I mean they could have died well could have died if something else to it doesn't have to be because of the color thing yeah so and the one before that was chemo which was captured and they talked about it in that book the white whale that was captured and that one had the disease it was like a immune disease yeah where they couldn't fight off you know so yeah sicknesses yeah oh here it is it's called Shadegg Higashi it's not that big actually that sounds like sushi oh it's a - dword yeah yeah Chiti achhi Gashi syndrome yeah yeah so affects humans and Wow so it's across the board for mammals yes so hopefully this Gracie killer whale is not that and it's just leucistic yeah and it lives a long time a lot of people keep commenting and saying a couple things one the rake marks uh-huh so we know that rake marks can be caused from what discipline play yeah like police yeah you know they kind of got to police each other yeah and then I'm even Dominus and stuff and then this is a gray whale so like the Rizzo shows up a lot yeah cuz the other killer whales have rake marks I just remember the picture I have the office has like full teeth mark I think pretty much every danta see if you get to scan their body yeah yeah that's guy stuff so it shows up a lot more so if you guys see the picture you don't have to be worried though you know he's not hurt like the rake marks aren't hurting yeah I'm sure my sting when it happened but I don't think they're trying to hurt him I mean unless you see like raw pink flesh or blood usually I do I don't really think they can feel it because they don't put much blood flow up at the surface of their skin cuz they would lose heat so they can kind of like shunt blood away from the surface like from the dermis because they got a feel at this otherwise yeah yeah I mean like you said they're tactile yeah yeah and then another cuz another thing people keep commenting and saying is that the eyes always close well how many shots have every well do you see yeah you know yeah it's very rare that you get it's bright with their eye oh yeah that's what everyone thought when we had a Kashmir level yeah Brazil oh our original up here that's white yeah out of all the cetaceans I feel like Rizzo's you actually get to see their eyeball the most I've seen I mean I've seen them I've seen Montana's common dolphins yeah a lot of times you see them underwater turn sideways yeah yeah I've seen them out above the water yeah yeah I have like a million humpback photos of the mud feeding into you and like that too and I can picture them in my head right now the two that I do that happen yeah one of them I was with you something you have to worry about but it's not something I mean you don't have to rule it out either I mean it's freaking bright up above the surface to like know they're in it you know the waters green it's not like they're always seeing it it's pretty dark when they go down yeah so yeah hopefully this will does really well they did the last day I was there someone did the day before they hadn't found a photo of it on his side and they found out it's a boy yeah that's a cold email transient Orca so that was pretty cool cool they're saying we're in history now to see that it's kind of yeah it's pretty neat moment I think last episode or the episode before we talked about iceberg because he'd recently been seen yeah yeah yeah over there in Japan he is like all white there yeah did it confirm it was iceberg and okay though um I don't know I mean I think they just assumed because it was male is there more than one male that's white I want to see there is I kind of think there might be but I don't know too much about it yeah I don't want to see that well too but I want to see me Galu as well oh yeah I would take my glue yeah celebrate I'd take either one but made did they just realize that he's like what 30 years old or something yeah I saw a paper article or something say they think he's 30 yes guys he can fight to his birthday party um no but it's in the middle of July because he's born in the southern hemisphere you and me have the same birthday Slater's yes birthdays because I say that in the winter do you not hear me say that on the boat oh yeah you can tell him happy birthday because they're all born around this time of year I mean they can be born on the way so they could be born early like the girls they're not always born as I say like mid mid to late December through late January they all celebrate their birthdays have a birthday wails oh yeah you know what's cool is their hearts so they're harbor seals up there you know how ours all gave birth last in april/may yeah there's all good birth like you like late maybe late June but July yeah because it what temperature yeah it gets later as you go north yeah and makes it it makes sense but it's just we would seep harbor seal pups like when we do field work out in Newport for like my spring quarter I was out there so la March April May into June and like I called you professor be like stop looking at the harbor seal pup go back to work like no it's too cute yeah the cutest thing ever all the Stellar's have pretty much left near the San Juan Islands hmm we saw one and then we went 50 miles north to entrance Island soon there was 200 of them there Wow isn't that funny that they haven't left yet like yeah we're starting to see the big males in Monterey I've noticed a lot of big a lot of big territorial males lately the last two weeks or so getting up on the dock causing chaos on the wharf and stuff tis the season yep so now what oh right we were talking about this earlier trips yeah so I've heard this with you know throughout the years you hear people say like oh I really wanted to see a bridge yeah so they go well watching and they basically had really high expectations because of probably us posting photos of whales breaching and they don't realize that we go in the water five to seven days a week yeah well here's another like general rule of thumb about social media everybody puts their highlights out no one puts their low lights out yeah you know like you only post your best things whether it's your personal life or success of your job or cool photos you got and so like it doesn't mean that it's like that all the time just because like someone's photos are all full of this cool action right like there's a lot of days where you know maybe it's not that exciting or in some places you may not see whales at all for a couple days before something really good happens and you know it's like setting expectations it's just be great to me it's like just be grateful for whatever you get to see yeah there's not only just breaching you know it's like you get the people who sometimes it just doesn't click and then they step off the boat like but we didn't see often we didn't see Orca yeah you showed them a killer well they didn't see humpbacks oh my god so just go on the boat with no expectation exactly and enjoy it and then if you didn't see what you wanted to see yeah go again the next trip go again the next day and go one more day after that because yeah it's most likely not gonna get done in one trip although sometimes in Monterrey sometimes you can get six different species are a tour but what's funny I think like 99% of our listeners probably understand this but it's there are people who don't understand that they really think they're gonna go out there it's like everything's gonna show up doing what you think they're gonna you know what you expect them to do and I feel like Slater and I especially I've talked about this several times because the last few trips we've been on we've gone specifically for whales and gone at least four days in a row Yeah right like because we know that you there's days you'll lose because of weather or you know there's days where the whales would be sleeping and you want to see him feeding her I don't think about this so the first trip I went on so I went on three trips that day the first trip we had right when we got there they must have killed something then they breached like a bunch of times right we left came back couple hours later they did some more breaches then we left and then we came back with like later on and they were all tied together in a pod like you know swimming we didn't spend that much time with them because we could tell they were like resting like but it was just like so they were doing they were doing different stuff in each trip but you know but the final one was they were just kind of chilling in Korean way yeah so it just shows you how different you can be from trips trip by the way the first trip it did have a couple preachers in it but the second one had a double breach and then every three stage yeah so yeah it's definitely different every time so spend as much time on the water as you can to put it simply yeah if you're specific you want to see then you need to give yourself an opportunity to go out on several days worth of trips yep for sure or you know if you're just out there to see some whales hey man great any day is a good day to see well yeah exactly yeah they always make you feel better that's for sure yeah I do I get less cranky me too but yeah if you're expecting stuff every time you go or like the one time you go yeah you should probably pick a new hobby I didn't go exactly the one time Slater didn't go they saw beaked whales yeah yeah it's a it's I know it's tough like for some people with trip planning and stuff and like a lot of times in the afternoon people like oh this is our only day we could have possibly gone and I'm like then why do booked for the afternoon or like why didn't you ask us about it or but yeah I get it I get it yeah with one hour to spare yeah well if you want to see well you should you know and with social media now it's like you see our reports you see our trends you know so it's like follow those yeah I'm gonna get it and we're happy to take one off tourists and business visitors as well it's just setting expectations before you get on the boat right yeah yeah so take the time I know you know obviously everyone has a different financial situation but what you spend as many many days he's can't on the water on the ferry ride into an island I met this couple and they were like yeah we're gonna go kayaking with whales and I was like probably not like that but like okay so you all know the kayak video in 10 when I lands where it's like flat guys kayaking in the milk it all goes right by them and people see that and they booked this trip good I'm gonna kayak with killer whale and even the kayak places are like you could see well so then I like makes you yeah but like going and you know talking with the whale watch companies I was like you know where the whales that they're go you know 26 miles from here yeah so that's what like the whales aren't always in that one spot where you go kayaking that's right a bunch that's like a once in a lifetime experience yeah and I and I'm not saying don't go kayaking it cuz you could go and it could happen right I'm just saying if you want to see whales go kayaking but go whale watching as well yeah and I told the guy I said I would I highly recommend cancelling your second kayak trips I gotta cuff me but go whale watching and yeah he they cancelled it and because it was also kind of bumpy they said the first time so they ended up canceling it and I ran into him the next day and they were like what are we going I was like you know go with my eyes and so they ended up booking and I didn't know whether they booked a morning or that for the afternoon luckily they booked the afternoon because the morning only saw humpbacks and they really wanted to see killer well they didn't see enough backs in Boston but that just shows you if they would have win the morning they would have been like oh well watching sucks yeah yeah so good thing they picked the right trip luckily yep but if they would have just went all day you know they would have saw a couple different things yeah yeah so get out there as much as you cancel that kayak trip just kidding go kayaking especially there it's beautiful so speaking of a lot of time on the water don't mean that to change the subject again but I don't know how we didn't figure this out but I guess may 31st just a little bit north of us another rare big step on the beach yeah Scott's Creek exactly where but I know it's up you're Davenport actually Wow so yeah the long green lab Santa Cruz yeah they picked up a parens beat well see that's one of the ones that is washed it up in California so it hits the California record but I don't think they don't alive in 19 but yeah only 5 between 1975 and 1997 the want to say this but yeah just just even going on a beach increases your chances or hanging out a cliff is gonna increase your chances of seeing things people yeah dude we were looking at like extinct animals today huh it's crazy like how many well obviously a millions of things are gonna see they're gone like it's like just like there's like cave Tigers in cave lions and hey bears oh yeah take what yeah just usually bear yeah but I mean I think that boy like 600 years yeah grizzly what not even let 200 barely 200 yeah yeah world's an interesting and serious place for sure how about them bald eagles out there everywhere you actually watched one flying around and then it went down and grab like a herring or something and brought to the nest and in the nasta had an eaglet oh cool yeah that was cool that's neat I didn't get one photo no I didn't actually I got a couple photos I like God it went it just picked it up in its claws but it's not like super sharp it was like so like running grab your camera at the st. you know yeah have you been in Alaska yet no i yeah people are telling me yeah it's like pigeons like they're just like hanging out by warps and stuff like that on fishing nets yeah I see videos of commercial fishermen trying to like shoo them off but like think about their beak in their talons holy cow that's a dangerous seagull fighting which is pretty crazy like the week before I went there for my first time last year and I think like September yeah someone got one carrying a fox away well geez yeah that's cool yeah I went there about them foxes yeah when I saw one Fox like two miles away in the brush you see one good eatin no no yeah I was expecting an eagle to grab one I got offered to go see the foxes this time when I was like I was six I think yeah you don't like it the Foxes it's like I was gonna use my energy on whale watching or nothing yeah whales are bust yeah eyepatch or bus or bust and one more sequence yeah go with my eyes more sequence we say in Monterey we say it is like one more look we're gonna get ceremony attend more Lux one more look at for like 20 more minutes might lunge against tank oh so this one's coming out before you guys remember we have the beach cleanup on June 8 yeah start 11:30 a.m. okay 11:30 a.m. 11:30 to 1:30 there's cleaning up all the trash we're gonna watch I'm down the water actually Eric's gonna see b12 out us again while we're cleaning the beach water too but I'm gonna go to the cleanup instead okay oh okay so Nate I'm leaving the 13th for graduation oh yeah yeah we're travelers yes we are this so it's this Saturday over I'm starting at Wharf - which is like technically del Monte Beach wait so you legit booked that's huh you look like legit bro - book - Cruz yeah yeah I'm leaving I'm gonna be gone most of September for a month two weeks three weeks what kind of what is this Carnival Cruise Lines no they dump trash handsome traumas are really weird last night so Margo had some YouTube video on her laptop and I hit play on it this guy's like if you want a 13th through the 29th wow that's a long trip yeah so I press play on it and this guy was like if you want to get stuck on the internet for hours just Google cruise ships you know in bad weather so then I was like cruise ships and bad weather and it's crazy I've been there for hours yeah then I could go to how many cruise ships have sank there's only been 16 and like only 15 of them were like all within like a 10 year span and and they I don't know they just had one like I don't know when but they have 12 I thinking that one in the Mediterranean yeah so it doesn't have a good end it's like one in like a thousand I do I'm crazy poor I'm fine don't just just don't get norovirus cuz the whole ship will get it yeah quarantine in my room oh yeah yeah oh yeah the quarantine people don't tell him you're sick you are like you're like oh my gosh that was my first boat job in 2012 when that one sank in the Mediterranean and I remember on it no I know I just remember being in the boat industry and people being like oh my god that ship to sink and they like would freak out about our whale watching I'm like it's not a curse that was the ones that wasn't that was all the captain's folly 110 shallow area was showing off he didn't yeah he didn't know the area very well he went into way to shallow water he was trying to entertain some women up on the bridge and they think he may have been drinking as well and he abandoned the ship Wow captain of the year yeah or just not even captain's but just boats and general mess in that hey what have you seen all you've been out in the water oh well I actually got to see three blue whales yeah I've been on the water when they've been seen here this year but I haven't seen one yet there's only been a few around oh yeah I was out with you and Sara and Jeff when they said I think we have a blue whale over here we'd never find it hmm and then yeah there was a blue whale the day before in the afternoon sign-off cannery row and then the nose right yeah the next day in the afternoon we were headed out to the point and the captain now were like oh I think there's a whale up here and then I kept watching I was like I think it's two and it was really windy and I was like those are really tall blows maybe it's just too big humpbacks or something and then we got closer and they went right by point-p nose like in the rocks like that's all does and it was two blue whales that's nice and then we found a third one wandering way too on the boat with me the other day we thought we talked to boot wells and it was an ambien hoback's it was right off psych cypress I think it was oh yeah yeah yeah that kiss max yeah cuz you were out or not that day right that was the day before that I saw them cuz I yeah I was like this is where we're heading south or which way were they going south okay yeah how many boats have been going south except at fishing boats but hopefully we can go out there soon hopefully they'll be out there when I get there speaking of choppy ending tomorrow supposed to be a superb day yeah I don't think anyone's going out tomorrow oh they are I'm going on a school group for two in the morning it's not supposed to happen to like 11 or something you can get most of the first trip in yeah I think my normal day on Friday that was gonna be a bust it looks windy all day we'll see I'm going back to United's boots yeah so this later was like I'm coming home the night the night before he's gonna leave and I was like well it is gonna be Whitney the next few days and he was like hmm I know I called mark I was like I think I'm gonna stay even though I already had like everything booked to go back but then he FaceTime me the next morning waiting for the ferry and I was equate I think you're suppose to be on the ferry already did you decide to stay yeah I did I skip the first ferry did you really yeah I thought he was staying on the island cuz he's like it's weekend anyway I found out there was another ferry like an hour or two hours later and I had a little bar by it and I was like guys one looks sketchy cuz has a little asterik well it what it means is it may or may not go to Lopez Island first okay so it's like gonna put me right at the time and I was like screw it [Laughter] [Laughter] it's always hard to leave a place like that yeah well I'm glad you had a good trip the rules in Canada right now are pretty crazy oh yeah they are 400 meters for private boats 200 meters for whale watching boats with a permit yeah because I mean all the way I watch boats got the girls basically the lens you recommend for shooting them right now is a telescope you know actually like as much as like compared to here or like Southern California where like there's not like it's just 100 yards you know well it wasn't that bad well they covered you everyone snowy like it really wasn't bad but yeah so it's actually only gonna be like that from now June 1st to October so it's not even it's just for the season mm-hmm it didn't go through like their state it didn't go through like the main thing it's just like I'm I don't even know regional yeah it's like just the thing they're testing for though it wasn't actually voted upon yeah so yeah you made me crazy though to me this morning as well talking about how you know there was a baby born in j-pod yeah while you were up there and people might see that as these new regulations helping the population but killer whales are pregnant for up to 18 months yeah so people know that like there's no immediate cause and effect as far as them having a baby boom yeah these regulations any of the regulations that they try to put against a whale-watching isn't gonna change anything within like this summer no especially I mean really what needs to happen to change the game is the fishery needs to adjust exactly so what they're trying to do though is you know put stuff against a whale watching yeah instead of fixing the real problem yeah low hanging fruit in my opinion so yeah but exciting that j-pod has a baby we didn't even talk about that yes now there's 76 subs resident you didn't get to see any residents while you're up there though no they were too out they were like two hours no not two hours they were pretty far north there until Fino whoa which is all that outside yeah yeah I bet it's rough I bet it gets rough out there it does they had a boat capsized there a couple years ago like a rogue wave and to me I didn't even know where that was until I google I've literally looked it up on a map of the day and I think oh that's on that like oh yeah that areas got some pretty neat that's cool that they're out there yeah I always think about him being in there that whole Vancouver Island's a neat place to check out it's not just whales there's all kinds of cool stuff over there yeah so I was telling so we were trying to think of like cool trips we could set up there like an all-day well watch but like you go up into British Columbia and then you stay the night there somewhere and then do more how cool would it be if you did like you saw orcas you know on the whale watch but then you win they have coastal bears all the time I've seen like yep five bear pictures posted this week yeah in wolves yep - so it'd be so cool to go see like bears and wolves and killer whales yeah one trip yep so that'd be fun it'd be a fun trip - do you guys want them right now um no maybe in September yeah if you weren't on the cruise yeah well okay then you're invited in September Eric have fun I don't know gambling or something whatever you do on a cruise standing on the bridge by himself freezing yeah Apple binoculars lying to you I don't speak our region oh man I'm sick a lot of people do that on our on our whale watch boats they see our wake oh my god we wonder actually get mad like mad tell people you know what I default to tell people will watch Naturalist protip I'm like okay then take a picture of it take a video of it take a picture of it oh we got so many travels coming yeah we do well not really duh Margaret has texted me and said that cast is moving to San Juans area okay so that was the first

slightly slightly emailed me so P is a naturalist for discovery whale watch yes and he's also a deckhand yes and why did you come here for whales yeah I came here for whales cuz did you guys I don't know if you guys knew but there are heaps of whales I don't think we've seen miles for a while oh you should go up okay I saw whales today - we are there except for me we all saw what kind of whales we saw on killer whales yes we did transient orcas see if it was you're here you're a naturalist did you go we're watching in New Zealand never been well watching in New Zealand not once a month I'll never so you saw but you saw whales on bird trips yeah okay that's like basically whale watching well like I never I never went out on like whale watching the boat in New Zealand so you specifically went birding now I worked on um I worked on with a company called monarch wildlife cruises so we did like just wildlife quizzes hey that's in the name it's basically whale watching what kind of stuff did you guys see we didn't really see why you know we would see every trip woodsy northern royal albatross that was like the main draw and they know like New Zealand fur seals New Zealand sea lions little blue penguins sometimes yellow eyed penguins I'll take some penguins here yeah I'll trade you I'll trade you our pelicans for your Penguins I will take that deal but tell everyone its significance of your blue penguins they're actually know what little penguins they're real cool there are little guys and they're blue and they are the smallest officially right so they're one foot long how to say that in feet what is it in centimeters thirty thirty centimeters Oh some like close enough like you round it it's like two and a half centimeters per inch is that right don't ask me I know if what's about yeah if it's wrong when I'm told so many times wait so how many all right so how long did you work on boats they're only worked on mostly for like last six months in New Zealand yeah yeah so I finished my master's degree and then I would just write lived on the boat no and then I was like your boats are cool they're nice I love him yeah and then I decided instead of doing what I did at university I was gonna stay away stay working on boats so what did you do at university I did zoology undergrad okay that was colleges coli Adam yeah yeah well crazy so what you do for your master's in wildlife filmmaking clearly well the degree is masses of science communication endorsed and natural history and science filmmaking that's actually pretty cool that's interesting yeah it takes so long to say that so I just say so basically you're just getting started in all this yes yes just starting so why not go to the well watch capital the world yeah how did that happen well um so I decided to go to America um because America is like real cool and yeah it was like January I think it was January February early on I was like yeah I'll get this visa my mates have done this visa it's like a 1-year recent graduate thing and I went onto TripAdvisor well I emailed everyone on that list and I said hey I'm coming to your town um give me a job literally didn't matter what town it was going oh it's going to the town one of the best ones around here I got the one who responded to my email here we are taking a chance on Pete yeah take a chance on page yeah see how it works how many new species have you seen since you got here oh so many new species um the Saint humpbacks in New Zealand I hadn't seen minke whales so I got minke whale nice yes I damn inky the other day we had yeah northern right whale dolphin Rizzo's dolphin mm-hmm miss if ik white-sided dolphin mm-hmm um Oh beards beaked whales oh yeah I'm glad you guys saw them just happy for me yeah never Eric seen him like two times I think already but you just were short of seeing the southern residence I think I could buy a week right the southern reasoning Comoros he showed up to be a great and 31st okay now I missed them 51 several times couple times now yeah what kind of good friends you see a blue well oh yeah so blue oil I think yeah now blue that was cool like yeah cool you're on the boat right did you see that three you're the one that's a little one yeah the next day we saw three oh I think the upwelling wind has been pretty good so there should be more hopefully fingers crossed big they'll be back in the middle of summer we'll get him yeah hey everyone come while watching with us cool yes a blue whale wasn't you that's probably I'd always wanted to see one night when I was like a real little kid I was like they're the biggest thing in the world yep I want to see that no that's all that he make it sound so easy there's all the northern right whale dolphins here yes and you have southern right whale dolphins off your coat I'm here doing it we do have some of you haven't seen them I've never seen something right well dolphins well because I am I live down south and I'm in New Zealand down in Dunedin and I'm there up you know I think they're more of the north of New Zealand I'm real poor I spent all my money coming over here so I've never really had a chance to say some of the cool stuff like sperm whales I am I nearly went to see the sperm whales a month or two ago but I decided to go watch albatross instead I see where your priorities are yeah okay so how about new species of birds since you've been here ah like heaps heaps highlights black-footed albatross yeah they've got that nice little white band yeah bill yeah I like that nice eyebrows too although the royal albatros has really nice features around the eyes too they do like that won't ring around the beats my favorite yeah I love the black fingers or reminds me of the add the liked mental sooty albatross commissary lot mantled sutil but oh really wow we're doing this they follow you here it kind of like feels like home when I look at the my okay what about calming MERS keeps a calm is right now chocolate oh yeah I got one of those a really bad signing so what's our top two puffin tufted puffins yeah you know northern fulmars right now no they're usually in the winter what yeah you guys can't to keep changing their times I don't see many this year as weird there really wasn't but we also didn't operate a lot of days this yeah this is they definitely are in the winter you think that oh they were in Iceland in the summer that's the way to go they were breeding there yeah but hey the Arctic Terns go there and they cross I mean yeah but they have a range it's not just one spa whatever well we could go and look at a bird I'm from one to a County and see what months I mean I think you could probably see them almost any month depending on the year but they're more common in the winter you know what's cool about the northern throne words well I guess Oh what is that no yeah they can actually drink salt water Prost Allah reforms yeah science yeah what about okay brown pelicans your favorite Oh like I'm just astonished that no one else is as amazed as I am but hang on hang on guys hello everybody welcome to the bird nerd five the other day we're watching the fifty ones either he's like look at the western girls wait you don't have dolls in New Zealand we have Gulf in New Zealand we have three species of garlic you probably like a million Basil's health girls yeah the ones that pick the right whales yeah they do pick the right one yeah well the whales are at the surface these goals like peck their skin really bad and can really mess them up give them a little mean I haven't seen that I've seen photos I've ever got yeah they're um they're vicious little birds I've been swooped by them so many times I'm way smaller than a right whale yeah he's easier prey you guys jealous of me by the way I've seen southern right whales I've seen heaps of southern I saw North Atlantic right whales yeah from the beat one thing I'm jealous about I needed right well all right Pete we're going to New Zealand let's go look at right whales let's do and you know nice where do I want to go the north right Auckland is it the north yeah go up go up to the north okay go down to the south cut co2 man go to cut Kona yeah like just is it Kota where the deers are well we'll see it cuz I've been saying it wrong the whole time it's with an R but it's a Modi wood so it's pronounced Kokoda you guys I follow a bunch of whale watching pages from there Auckland in kaikoura and they see a lot of cool stuff anyway they got like sperm whales killer Hector's dolphin right oh yo he's dolphins Oh freaking out oh really break it out and love pictures dolphins you see this man I love seen so much of them he said he could swim with them right one of the base was the once yet stop recording recording I said it was illegal but it was by no means unethical cuz I'm I I got the water and I'll just kind of swim in and they just came up to me nice yeah I believe it they're cute I'm sure most dolphins are curious and they were like following my dodge it was only in two meters of water and I'd like pop up to the surface and breathing then go down come with me kid almost touch the bottom I couldn't oh yeah yeah if I was standing my head would just be under the water it's so calculating two meters in my heads about all the time with their dorsal fin is so nice you guys seen pictures yeah yeah a bride it's me it's like a love heart but chopped in half yeah like the flat on the back yeah I mean killer whales from the from the drone they have a heart on their back from their saddle patch they have a hot on the back yeah you guys it's wholesome Pete laughing is it really yeah well he has a birding one two birding Peter what is it birdie with Pete so hey what do you guys see this afternoon when I left - I'm back I knew it I knew it I picked a good one to go home it was so hot so hungry I was like I gotta enjoy this day only only in Monterey are we like oh just to hump after we just saw a particular was it like for an hour or whatever yeah tell me about your guys's morning trip it was okay yesterday - guys tell them what did it look like from the boat because I was flying the drone for pretty much to encounter you were on the but I didn't scream what I'm saying I mean I was watching obviously I look up to follow the drone but yeah I'm saying like when you say okay first off you guys we were watching the killer whales yes and then they took a left towards a kayak well one of them did started yeah and she circled I had the drone up I had just gotten the drone back up I was changing batteries got over the kayak and well over the killer well followed it right into the kayak and it did like a couple circles yep and then it did this weird little like you know like stood stood up underwater yeah I've kind of looked at it for a second and continued on did you guys see the dorsal fin next to the kayak yeah you can tell I got that shot I still got a review that you can totally tell it approximately and that this guy yeah respectful you know he just stayed out to around the boats heaps it came to me kind of moved back over to well yeah after I left towards the boat said this guy was really yeah oh yeah once it was like I would have been scared if that was my house it was close I don't know I guess because I know those whales pretty well I wouldn't just stop there and be like what's that yeah and ride away when that happened I knew knew what people were telling me oh okay if you see bumper coming straight at you like I feel like he's gonna hit my kayak and that's how it ends like you would actually grab you even if he knocked you know what I think he would just shove me in the water and I'd really great but right away when that happen no yeah right away when that happened we told you no you know what the what's going through our passengers head they told me you got guys I've never been an incident in the wild a confirmed incident about you know these animals being aggressive with her out there speaking of like never having an int in the wild in that book that I keep referencing every podcast they had someone in the net with the killer whales cutting one of the killer whales out of the net and the mom ran over to it and just stopped and watched him did it it could have just killed him I mean yeah you would think when they're being captured that that would be the moment they would grabbing human still did it Wow isn't that weird it's amazing how much gentler animals are yeah that's telling people like yeah I mean even like we all had that gray whale experience where they're literally under your boat holding it up and they can easily go boom you know flip over the head and put in the water but they're so gentle they know you're there and it's just never never ever felt scared around them have you guys been seeing the videos in Baja lately know what you see they've been swimming with killer whales like you see more at one time yeah more than four or five times Cabo oh wow yeah and they they've done it multiple times huh and it's freaking cool like I find it show me later down the column I want to go I mean it's not like you know it's not a guarantee you're gonna see them they said they just were lucky that whole week that they stayed around Wow whole week yeah and then it's funny because while I was down in Baja for the stew whale sharks the naturalist I was on board it says for the in Baja for the gray whales her sister had has jumped in and I think we talked about this she jumped in with the orcas off Cabo before to define interact with the swimmers at all well do they just you know the videos it seems like they kind of come over and you know I Cal okay them and do their thing and check them out and they keep yeah they continue on wasn't in your homeland when that lady was like swimming along the beach and yeah we shouldn't a pedal board or something was about to grab her foot yeah I think it's from why does it seem so much more like crazy when you see something like that but yet there's something with him like every year in Norway you know yeah it's like for some reason I think I would hop right in the water in Norway and anywhere else that'd be like I would do it but I'd be skeptical for a minute other stuff is like one-off things where the killer will initiates the encounter more often and whereas in Norway people go where the killer whales armed are they're feeding and purposely get in the water there to try and have underwater viewing a pizza while you're here do you recall so I know here you know we have the Marine Mammal Protection Act do you guys have specific laws or guidelines to how you guys interact with marine mammals out there yes my boat was interacting with Penna Pete's visitations and but so we had a permit to approach them oh okay yeah yeah think about everything's like everything didn't stop me it's like distances that you guys abide by um our boat we we didn't really have distances because of our permit oh we would get right up to UM to like you know fur seal colony on the rocks like so close to pups but you know I could hit them with a rock if I Will Survive and then you know you get like the New Zealand sea lions like circling right around you but on land in New Zealand approaching on pinnipeds where that on the water like you know you saw humpback like we do out here you guys wait we kind of because we don't see whales too much on the water behind we kind of stick back okay like from from my company I've seen Orca I've seen humpbacks and I've seen southern right whales and we just you know we kind of don't approach them okay well number one our skippers really to experience with large marine mammals how could we see them once a month or so okay so we give them a good distance okay look at the closest viewing I've had of a whale back home was um when we nearly ran over a southern right whale this podcast this podcast is a demo what's going on in New Zealand down in the downtown or there was a whale there cuz there would mean to be right this is a good moment to let you guys know that if there's possibly whales in your area that you should post yeah oh you're not sure go slow and just know birders are crazy well so our harbour is 22 kilometers long right and um there the whales used to live there these to use it as a nursery and then they've got Eden they all got killed yeah I was humpbacks in southern rights 1800s where a whaling station set up killing over 300 whales a year it was only there for a decade and then all the whales disappeared staying like ten miles offshore where there were our Kenyan is so there's still like migration paths so you just never expect to see a whale in the harbor and then one morning we're just me and my skipper we're just going to work and then the southern right whale just comes up running from us right but up in the north like Auckland and kaikoura I'm pretty sure they have regulation flow it's probably 100 meters or no yes 150 meters or whatever it is like 100 meters yeah so yeah because there is regulations every part definitely regulations yeah yeah okay so tell me tell me about the pinnipeds the pinnipeds we have well we had two that were residents to mainland New Zealand now we have three I'm so happy about that guys it's a big long story okay so New Zealand fur seals New Zealand sea lions on both hunted to near-extinction both recovered after stealing stopped both you know kind of loved by the general public mm-hmm but then the lipid seals yeah oh yeah they're starting to come there or something well so um they were classified as vagrants and everyone was like oh these guys are just coming out from Antarctica yeah it's just like a one-off thing yeah let's walk that's all they thought it was Wow and there was one her name was alpha and she sit up on a marina up in Auckland that's scary I didn't want to walk by one in a marina holy moly my paws of them seals it's so chilly so chilled do you know people Hannah one of the little blue penguins we like these bite-sized penguins they were doing a lot of research and they started like getting like citizen scientists on board yeah and so they started getting more and more sightings reported yeah I started realizing what they were and because they just hauled out on beaches and you wouldn't know where that show up and they started looking at like ancient um ancient moldy middens like I like the old like fire pits and funny bones and they've just got all this research and they were just like yo turns out these guys are residents oh so they found leopard seal bones in the mittens yeah Wow okay so leopard seals but they're more like a undulate like carbon seals are they like you can get up and run like a sea lion so they're a true seal so they can't do that well on land huh no see you yeah see you can walk right up to nobody okay they're bigger than you know they can probably undulate pretty quickly though I would think so yeah we say about 20 meters yeah 100% because you know they're just quite scary but more sensitive I guess like it's not really for a human it's more for them you know yeah so are they just going up on sandy beaches mainly sandy beach that's so cool to think about cuz any picture you always see is like in Antarctica where there's ice yeah I'm sure pictures of them just lying in the so you've seen pictures of them Wow I thought he did you see I thought you were just starting to show up well let's just say that I would prefer to be attacked by a leopard seal than a sea lion any day of the really any day of the week why well one because like two times bigger I don't know their sea lions are pretty big maybe about non-flow yeah first you are the way what are they feeling sea lions oh I have no idea are they the ones that I lay on the lawn chairs no it's like a video from my coop wheel isn't that like sitting on my lawn chair oh it's like that man you know I go to at that old dilapidated research building yeah I got to look up the New Zealand first yoga or the New Zealand sea lion yeah his even sea lion yeah I got a sea lion dude they are up and I've landed on so there's a place called air in Derby Island it's in New Zealand sub-antarctic zone uh-huh and I was landing there from a zodiac one day and um it was like breeding season males females name the big bull males were just in the zone man Choji chasing by those guys it's kind of more like a stellar sea lion fish wow yeah make sure it's like a fur seal face well pretty soon you'll see how big the males get for California sea lions cuz they're starting to come down the coast to get ready for breeding season so we'll have like our biggest males in the harbor like soon the next week or two and then they start to all thin out and go to be back yeah wait so you think that your sea lions are bigger than our seal and they look pretty similar if not smaller something about guys are pretty look thicker actually yeah yeah there's some big ones yeah during the rut our Zelan posted a photo down a new port of a huge one on one of the be ready for breeding season the females are having pups now and then they go into estrus right after they give birth basically do you have a favorite encounter that you've had so far with whales here yeah so far yeah rub it in should I pick another one there was there was one day when we were out in the Monterey Bay somewhere and it was just a good day and there was this one humpback whale who just decided he was gonna be nice to us I think you were there Slater and now they just they just was lunging ah lunging lunging lunging - thanks so much like one just one here it was lunging like him you know every minute or two about like we've been having so much anchovies there in the harbor is like millions of anchovies and two up X yeah even in the harbor there's a whole bunch right now we're cleaning the bow just look down so I don't have to tell you something about the month of June you guys know it's my least favorite for the whale watching because this always happens yeah they get crazy in April May and then they show up they're like scope out the coast and then they come back and usually the weather is pretty windy and June - some years it's okay but some years it's awful well you know what we had such a good May or was it may whatever the blue water lunge feeding remember that April beginning of May yeah that was crazy yeah yeah when I first got here was pretty insane there's blue water - right we had like northern right well dolphins and Pacific white-sided every day there's a good blue water and then August I've really I think August and September my favorite answer though really yeah I feel like the weather seems to be okay and then yeah good days on November you know humpback so yeah all you can watch humpbacks everywhere I care passing miles humpbacks and then I don't know it'll be like 50 blue will somewhere like maybe it's not gonna be for like weeks straight but it'll happen and then I'll be there wholesomeness what about the lace and albatross where is it in early spring so you didn't have to wait that's another thing that I missed this year flew right by and then I'm like looking forward I'm just eating gold and it was I couldn't buy an eyes attuned to that albatross wing shape hey well I just yeah I saw an albatross one time Jason I left my memory cards at home and then I used my micro SD card and an adapter put it in my camera took a picture of it it took it out lost them micro SD card so my only Laysan albatross and it was like crash-landed next to the boat and then it was like taking off when it comes to bringing memory cards Oh actually yeah well I officially got like a huge case there's a stay in your backpack yeah oh yeah giving him my batteries I'm like dude they're probably all dead I have one full one it's all I need I don't usually burn through battery in a day so it's like when it's just normal well watches Melissa yeah like when I was in San Juan Islands I've burned through all my batteries and I didn't take that many photos photos because they're going for IDs so they like when you're doing IDs of killer whales you know you want to give them like holes and then you hope you got some of it I remember those days yeah I did some of that back home whenever we saw orcas I was instructed by one of my co-workers who studied Orca just to take photos the entire time they were there so like that's across the board how killer whale IDs yeah so the orcas you have back home they're all nicked up crazy like the dorsal fins are really don't they eat like sharks skates and rays yes oh yeah like rows like I'm like lots of stingrays yeah and they're actually really cool when you see them come into our Harbor our harbors really shallow like six foot average but then there's a really big shipping channel a really really deep play for cruise ships and container ships to come in and so you'd catch sight of these Orca and then most of the time when we saw them it was like a smaller group it was one group of three that I saw a couple of times and and you just see them making their way down the channel why don't either side on one in the middle they're just searching for those stingrays down at the bottom that's so cool yeah that's cool and they're there yeah they nicked up there's one guy Cameron Bure is named but he's got like a big spiral shape at the top of his dorsal fin my favorite so it's funny all the video you see from New Zealand is like that like that greenish like turquoise it's not like dirty it's not like our color green it's not dark but it's like that light kind of like out what's today exactly yeah I know what's today yeah have a nice I think am i bent yeah I don't normally give I tell people I don't get bent yeah you told me that the other day but make sure you even put on sunscreen yeah you're gonna get burned get hot it's okay for the white guys yeah typical they actually got closer to the boat yesterday yeah but yeah very similar experience today but I think Oh lighting seem to be better than ocean get this in school commerce so that was made better viewing yeah cool and I was cleaning up much Lisa vomit today I tell people this is you know me using my sorority experience in the real world [Laughter] clean about dick in 15 seconds yeah exactly so Slater and I we're not on the boat yesterday seeing the killer whales because I was picking up trash yeah yeah Tina yeah before we talk about that today on Instagram I was like finally looking through stories so many people picked up trash like everywhere like I saw at least I see so many I saw like four accounts but in different they all have that groups of people and their stories picking up trash I didn't really do a good job I just posted one video of the dumping trash but there was a lot of people I showed of drive to ours as well yeah how many over 50 50 yeah oh that's awesome that's good there wasn't even like bro it took me so long to find a piece of the beach knows like that's a good thing I had to go there I had to go I went up on the REC trail and was walking the REC trail yeah and then like I found this bush with like some beer hidden in it I'm like just sitting somewhere hiding people come back with like kickstands and like yeah oh you found the kickstand - Myka Earth Day we found the kickstand in a break in the petal like hold your bike hold your bike up when it's yeah so we found bike parts on the earth day one and then on the world oceans day one yesterday we found a bike pump more tent pieces we always find pieces of tennis is there the weirdest stuff was like two of those dining trays from McDonald's [Music] they really want it to get men chocolate melting pot complete with a half used bar of chocolate oh that's where I went I was gonna do night on the beach it's a wall plug end though like I don't even know how they were using it before I left the lady walked up and said she had like two hundred-plus cigarette butts 430 count'em yeah she was counting while she's picking them up or what that woman is always on the lookout for environmental things when she's walking around she okay documenting everything yeah cuz next thing you know I see a post like 400 I think I'd like to on the REC trail yeah in just two Danny picked up a couple yeah in just two hours there was you know 600 plus dang how many are in the ocean a lot to me jeez yeah now that's so important though that all that cleaning up stuff a like man I just get up sit with all the trash around we picked up nine balloons today yeah three-peat stole my thunder I was up there and he just comes running from the starboard side and grabs and I was like I wanted someone it was cool this is how it's this is how it's done don't want us like that's how cool you do that I was like thank you and then like he just runs up and does another as long as we get him out yeah that one that the first one he picked up the cluster of him all the paint gone you know just like a little bit around the edges and you know it's been there for a long time you know how long I mean for sure probably over a month for it - did you know more than that I'd say six to eight months but a lot of graduation balloons it's it's annoying to me as well because balloons are one of the least necessary yeah it's like and I can always tell on the boat you know you might as well take that five dollars you spend on a balloon and just hand it to him personally it's not better than most man the worst times of year for balloons is New Year's Valentine's Day Easter and Mother's Day graduations there's Easter balloons yeah look at your egg shape mm-hmm floating baskets no but you know what what about the Easter eggs they're plastic I'm surprised if you don't see those ever [Music] ours put stuff in it like yeah obviously do not do this in New Zealand there's more money if they're fancy surprise if you're flossing we hide the eggs yeah all right that's one thing we gotta do a peer not wrong but you're not that money so many things Pete needs to do in America Olive Garden Easter egg hunt I actually Eric told me he was driving me to Olive Garden to America oh yeah Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday well what times all become close so the beach cleanup was good it was nice to see so many people out it was a really nice sunny day there was also a lot of people on the beach so I think it was kind of good to have that visible we had some compostable trash bags donated from a company in the Bay Area and that was really nice and then we used a lot of buckets as well and then we did tally up the trash the volunteer who coordinated from environment for the exact mess can it tallied everything like straws cigarette butts glass items plastic bottles all that kind of stuff and she's gonna submit it so oh but yeah and then the city of Monterrey actually because we did a little bit different planning they actually came and picked up the trash fed of hauling it yourself yeah instead of us hauling it ourselves so the way that we set it up this time around they they were willing to come get the trash for us which was nice yes that was nice and it was cool to see all the trash get hauled away yeah I hope in the pictures I left earlier tonight it was really nice hopefully you guys also did some stuff for World Oceans Day showed your love to the environment I mean for us World Oceans Day is every day but you know if you had a little celebratory event I know seafood watching Monterey promoted a lot of events around town too which was really cool think about the good karma that happened on a World Oceans Day you guys saw killer whales yeah our friend Adam that's been on this podcast had a friendly humpback yeah sandbanks what happened to you he picked up trash picked up the trash we talked about an epic day of water so you were the one giving the car that is good karma Nelson I like when people make take the initiative to actually go up there and clean up the trash themselves hands on not being on the internet or Facebook going oh we should do this but I really appreciate people actually getting up and doing things but I had to be on the boat but previous cleanups yeah Eric basically said that he didn't want to pick up trash actually I had to be I had to be on the boat working as a naturalist [Laughter] I've been at all the cleanups for the last one and I know he had a lot of stuff he picked up I remember I think I clean up bike parts every time I get to the people already cleaned up everything just arrived Julio well I mean it's nice that the beach is already pretty clean the winter one I think we picked up the most trash in the shortest amount of time but the spring and summer ones we're not as dirty yeah but you know every little bit counts especially with all those stuff that's coming out about microplastics Lisa and our beaches are central California surprisingly clean compared to Southern California but hopefully you know we're inspiring people to take initiative in their own I think they might have done one down there so I wanted someone did yeah we're gonna do one further up north like you know over there so Rocky I wonder if they still do clean up sure some people do we need air to your beach I won't we don't need a dirtier Beach but we should go find one so we can clean it yeah wonderer place is like you know like way up north Poplar while watching places like San Juan Islands that they do cleanups there well there's not really beaches for like we're gonna do go to like some wood and tell us more about the San Juan Islands aren't you going well I understand when is beautiful so they keep it clean a two-day San Juan Island trip September 21st and 22nd it's two full days on the water both ships are both days have an eight-hour whale watch and it's during a great time of year to see southern resident and then transnih orcas all the humpbacks will be feeding there so it's a really cool time to get on the water yeah and the backdrops are second to none it's the Falls really nice to me here to be up there not only that sound that's all about the great boat you guys are going on fast and comfy yeah I can't even explain the boat like it's just amazing out of all the boats all the ribs I've been on like it's not really any we get started on it it's it's like a boat that has indoor cabin so you can be away from the like cold weather but then all of it opens up completely so you can photograph out of anywhere in the boat yeah like all the windows open up you know it's funny is the boat was actually manufactured in New Zealand well the whole is except for you guys you guys color them really funny cuz it like purple and yellow anyway guys if you're interested in going to see hopefully see some killer whales or just have fun time on the water check out my website it's Slater more dot photography and then it's under trips under all day chores it's gonna be pretty fun yeah it should be a good trip I kind of want to go alright you know where to book well thanks for joining us today P yeah hi everyone go to New Zealand listening because some of the stuff there will be dead soon what Wow that's often the subspecies dolphin 60 individuals left reported I hear about that where do you hear about it me no I think cuz they kind of you know fall into the same line of rhetoric with the vaquita it's a bike at tissue that Maui's yeah it's not being reported and it's a whole nother issue we could do a whole podcast about maybe we can't well google it and they won't talk about also it org you the state they did some genetic studies while I was there on Hector's and Mary's oh cool same thing no some species yes so that I comment off in short people on beach there we go again we had a Pete we talked this morning about that all right you guys thank you so much for listening if you don't follow us on Instagram it's wale nerds yeah thank you so much yeah and check out our patreon thanks again Maria for your for your support online we really appreciate it once again thanks everyone for listening oh thanks guys you're welcome Pete [Laughter]

-

hello everyone and welcome back to the well nerds podcast this is episode number 25 mm-hmm my name is Slater and I'm here with Eric and Caitlyn hey everyone hello and we are super excited because we had a great day on the water the last couple of days oh yeah what did you see yesterday yesterday I had the most notable thing was a pot of six Orca that we're we're kind of funny because we were watching humpback whales and we looked off in the distance maybe a little bit more than a quarter-mile away we see some dorsal fins popping out of water newer kind of not small but not really big so I was like oh look like there's dolphins and then my crew is like oh no that doesn't look very Rizzoli so we get closer and closer I was like wow this is really weird what are these things turns out it was six six Orca no mature males but it looks like was like one sprouter yeah that a thick dorsal yeah for sure yeah and then one larger one larger a lot larger but one female and then a bunch of doobies aren't they Adam super yes eventually yeah eventually when I put the pictures that pounds like those are my super ultra rare transients and I'm like are you positive and like look at my pictures of your pictures disease that I'm positive oh yeah he's only seen like three pods yeah so here's IGAD those are the ca1 22s and I guess the original the matriarch 1:22 herself is actually no longer around but this is this is the pod this is who's left and yeah I was pretty interesting they're there they're tiny not a tiny pod but tiny individual underneath thing about the pod it seems like they all have really big eye patches too so they're really neat looking did they kill anything didn't kill anything actually it was kind of one of those almost glad they weren't in hunting mode because they're just traveling so we saw them off of Carmel Bay and it just kept on going up and kept on going up kept on going up to the point whatever actually moved at a high rate of speed porpoising but still going in a straight line and then later on when we handed them off to the rest of the fleet they were having a harder time with it so we got there at the right time interesting like three pieces of the there's like three ridges in the canyon right before Carmel Bay depending on how far out you were and it's real easy to lose the whales there I don't know what it is about the bathymetric qualities of the area but like I've lost killer whales right around Carmel Base so many times mm-hmm because they can either follow the canyon in they can keep going on a straight line or they can go southwest yeah I've lost killer whales in Carmel towards you yeah leaving like exiting Carmel Bay yeah yeah okay and the day before that we had the CA 50 ones mm-hmm and how weird is it that you have like one pod then they leave and then another pod comes in and they leave yeah no it has to be there has to be some correlation I wonder I also speculate a lot like do they meet up offshore somewhere yeah like it's always it comes in like a wave like that yeah it actually does if you think about it it does and then one thing just Caitlyn just said yeah it kinda makes me wonder if I click they met up offshore it's like the 122 is you know it's like why are they so rare but this year what two sightings at least one here one down and yeah our Channel I'm just one before Adam saw these super ultra rare animals was the last sighting you know you remember oh you can before well when Adam saw them oh yeah man are they really Wow super ultra rare and I know they were around in that really big season in 2016 even like Slater's that $1.99 that we thought was George about that I remember yeah when the last time they saw that whale it's funny because I was asking John today anyway if humor if he has see if there's any whales he hasn't seen in a long time and he was like I haven't seen see a 100 I was like hey we just saw that whale not too long ago I haven't seen see a45 since we cited them one time in 2016 we cited them 14 miles offshore and they hadn't been seen for 8 or 12 years before that and then last year there was that CA 10 that popped up and I guess that's like a once a year or maybe every few year well that shows up and I still think they party off the organ I think they go offshore a little bit to you yeah I mean it doesn't take much to be out of our range in the perspective of whether they could sit out 30 miles off the coast and never see another thing you know we keep on thinking oh you know we here in Monterey we see more Orca and you know certain California we don't see them as much but come to think like habitat wise and food availability is like Channel Islands that'd be such an ideal place for an orca you know South down the coast right now from wherever they were because they're following yeah either the stellar sea lions exactly look for new sea lions headed to the breeding like we all like we all talked earlier it seems like Oregon's kind of like a dead zone with not many whale watchers you just never know who's crossing through they're hanging out there a little uptick in the fall in September in October because that's when the males are back from breeding yeah so maybe they're following the males down offshore to the Channel Islands now because they're all hooked up getting ready to go to breeding yeah can I think about your rare oh yeah so see a 10 n 25 that was another one that showed up twice last year and they're like I've never even heard of the whale mm okay yeah yeah that year I think 90% of the transient killer whale population checked in yeah he also had that year the whales right before I left to San Juan Island who are they the CA for the no it was some low numbers and then Ritchie was there oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah I forgot the number but the random numbers this year yeah which is cool you know who we haven't seen for a while is jagged the 216 oh yeah we haven't seen her group for a long time she's like all female types yeah travels with her yeah I saw her in front of Moss a few years ago but I don't remember any recent appearance I've seen Batman for a while either actually don't sit don't say that I miss his buddy chop Finn used to always be side by side with him I never saw chop van soon as we got there we never saw him yeah he's a good well him and choppin there Daisy be side by side showing really well they were good he was a good whale yeah today we had a mom and calf humpback whale oh cool back whales huh and it was in the fog it was really exciting actually it was cool we were watching the mom and calf and then they ran right into a pot of northern right whale dolphins and Whitesides and then I was like everybody like do you know how the Dolphins kind of like circle like really tightly like really quickly like a chasing food well uh huh so like you guys pay attention they might serve like sometimes they get the calf you know black and sure enough you like the calf kind that didn't spy out but it like lifted his head up a lot more and then kind of like rolled that's cool yeah so then a bunch of northern right whale Dolphins popped up right real close to it is this that extra white calf on the bottom was it that one there's one cat on the white it was pretty dark but yeah so they played around for a little bit uh-huh and then we they kind of then they it was actually like not even five minutes ever together and then they split off they both went complete opposite directions one went north into the canyon and then one went down her headed south mm-hmm we stayed with the dolphins for a little while longer and then image of the other another we passed a back calf off to another boat they actually had to find it because it's in the bog yeah and then I guess it was doing some breach such a weir and I was watching you guys I noticed that here in Monterey it was like the nicest day ever then I looked for girl Shore was like oh and I heard you guys complaining on her ad I was like wow that's weird you know they were like it's been too hot for too many days the fogs coming yeah you can literally see it like over by the mall like rolling into the higher parts yeah we could see it was just coming into the parking lot yep yeah it's pretty cool it was cold and windy too straight line from like the point to Marina yes straight across yes today was nice I did well I did well thing on land since I didn't get to go with my friend Brian and Emily to teach middle schoolers about whales at summer school would you teach videos like baleen whales and then odontocetes and they were actually when we got there they were like fourth through seventh grade oh wow like quite a wide little kids range huh so we like made them get up and move every ten minutes or so would be like swim like how do you think of jellyfish swims or how do you think the fish swims are like let's pretend the krill or we lined them all up in the classroom you're like this is how long a whale is like it was pretty fun did lots of questions really cool so that's cool yeah oh yes I'm Nick you guys doing that where'd you get those shirts we both happen to buy that humpback whale sure did Old Navy Oh funny and then I was who they were like we were prepping the night before and Brian was like I'm gonna wear this whale shirt I have and I was like wait a second is it this whale shirt and I pulled out of my closet and he was like yes yeah I have I have I have that shirt too how do you do yes different version of it I have a studio maybe I have it like a super nice button-up that huh killer whales on it it ripped and I was no it was like one of the coolest button apps I ever had yeah so then Emily really was feeling like she had some FOMO right like she was like I want a will shirt it was a really like one left at the one over here and filled in yeah yeah okay so now you and Brian have badges yeah it's two twins i'ma call him next time I see him yeah wear that shirt yes that was fun I think what else other than what I saw shark the other day oh you see Eric mainlanders photo of the great white shark with a shark bite on it no that's intense cool yeah I almost didn't look like shark like the way it was like rake marks really yeah but but then you could see that it dug in did he say it was a shark or was it a sea lion because sometimes the sea lions fight back mouth would have been huge oh really oh just a shark it was like why oh god I see that yeah yeah that's pretty cool I guess there's a lot of sharks around yeah up by Aptos in that area well you know how we beasts always think Aptos I guess some locals have been saying there off of Marina State Beach oh really yeah just like hanging up out there and just looking down since it's a so easy wait what and it's really cool hopefully you guys can find that photo did you find it no big shark it's a I guess it's like ten feet high it's actually technically still juvenile right he said to like what yeah we're loving this you're so then they look 10 11 ish yeah that's when their teeth start changing and the diet starts changing yeah they start biting their friends you know who I want to see this summer who hook the blue whale yeah who is he famous well where have you seen hook at I've seen hook back I've seen it I'm off of Orange County well how's that Dana Wharf I see them over in Long Beach by the rigs when I was working for you acquire and I seen him in Big Sur and I've seen him also like more north towards like the SoCal I've seen them everywhere or not on the coast we're not talking about Captain Hook there's a blue whale that we don't know if it's go over huh I don't think so well this whale half of the fluke is actually like how would you think this figures yeah I would say sit I don't think it's a bite I think it's a disfigurement yeah yeah for sure to clean instead of it's like yes it's like a sickle it's like the leading edge so like towards the front of the body is there like yeah yeah I've seen I've seen it all over Southern California and then I saw it up here yeah I think it was either last time or the Sun Room everything was less you might have been looking yeah we might indicator I think mm-hmm it's over like five hundred miles yeah it's pretty amazing that's why I love telling people especially look for like people like us who've worked everywhere traveled everywhere it's kind of neat to see to tell people yeah I've been like six hours south and seen the exact same pods are exact same well shows you how much room they really need you know yeah and how much more they're spreading out - exactly sure so the between talking about hook and then there was actually some killer whale news from the Atlantic coast I was thinking maybe we should talk about yeah nice whales in general yes I saw the video after seen every day for that a few days ago it keeps getting shared yeah so the video we're talking about is there was a killer whale sighted off the coast of Cape Cod swimming with Atlantic white-sided dolphins which is newsworthy for two reasons one because they don't really see killer whales that often off of the eastern seaboard and two it's pretty rare to see killer whales swimming with other dolphins and I think no one's confirmed the ID that I've seen but I think a lot of people are speculating that it's this killer whale called old Tom that they see off the eastern seaboard and all the way up in the bay Fundy a couple of people I know have seen him this lady Joanne who works at Hyannis well watch cruises out of Provincetown and then this other lady Shelley who works up at Brier Island whale watching seabird cruises so Provincetown is down in Cape Cod and then Brier Island is all the way up in the lake on the south end of the Bay of Fundy so like that's a pretty big area like you're talking Nova Scotia Massachusetts yeah and they don't really from what I know they don't really know much about him like is he transient is he resident is the offshore but he is seen swimming with dolphins that's cool and that's not that's a second case this year in different areas because they just had the northern resident swimming with Pacific white-sided dolphins mm-hmm can you imagine yeah like not chase not hunting but just like swimming like just you know bow riding like Y tides with the blue whale but with a killer whale that's so cool pretty awesome so there is another old Tom killer whale that's famous that is actually from Australia yeah they the last sighting was like 1930 is when he washed ashore dead and they have the skeleton at the eat in killer whale museum in Australia that's the one I always thought you were dead we mentioned that name but the one I was thinking about he was like they thought he was like one of the leaders of a pod of killer whales that would help heard other whales into a bay so the Whalers could hunt them really yeah well I've heard that kind of line of rhetoric yeah kind of a story story about that yeah they do in where is it it's in Alaska right they are no they bring the they chase the narwhal somewhere and then though the natives use the killer whales to pin them in the cove or pin them somewhere Wow yeah did they talk about that in that book at all no this is something else I think it's in a documentary on like Netflix because I know like the Whalers there was some sort of benefit where they kill it it seemed something like that that the killer whales would like get a benefit of getting some of the meat or something yeah and then like that was their deal not cool that's kind of cool there's another famous Australian well the white ones the white one nicholae blue I want to see mingle I want to see mailers here I've met people who've seen two people but I've never actually seen it but that whales doing surprisingly well for a possibly they confirmed it may close up I know they have boat they swam with it so I mean yeah people swam with that well I think we've talked about this before but yeah animals leisure that that condition usually always have other issues that make him not to viable and also like being bright white that makes you like hey look at me eat me and with some other animals you know it's but they think he was born in 1986 wow he's pretty old he's in his 30s that's old I mean for a whale that potentially like could have other health issue skin likes thank you exactly maturity and he's been an adult whale for quite a long time and hasn't really had an issue he so he's an Australian humpback which means he goes down to Antarctica for feeding season so maybe maybe that's part of why it doesn't really have any as many issues you know the waters pretty murky and blends into the ice and could be has many problems down there speaking of this skeleton show yeah I didn't well I went in the whale museum and I put in armor which is really cool yeah yeah I will killer whales they have dolphin - yeah they've I think they have common dolphins they're like minke whale bones gray whale skull but I actually went in the center for a whale research I didn't go in that building the first time and they have one they have a full to take a wooden dorsal fin of a male killer whale and I stood up next to it and it supposed to be like a life-sized one uh-huh it tells me I mean it's a little shorter but it's still really crazy and you go back take a picture that'd be cool stand right next to it had like a big male killer whale or something hot yeah yeah like it's the teeth are huge yeah I didn't know they're that big oh yeah you no longer the teeth of them I'm gonna kill everything like six inches bigger one a little bit shorter than that right now they were big well cuz they go down in the gums and stuff but I mean proof I have a picture of me I think it's somewhere on my Twitter like holding my arms out like I'm kind of holding this mounted killer whale skull at Cal Academy and yeah it's like the face is longer than my arm yeah that's what it always takes they get a stand up you know a human for scale yeah we always like get pretty sad about strandings and stuff like that but I think we talked about how me and Slater have been doing a few strings you have been to a few stranding that's it that's like a few chances you can really get you know to feel the true size of these animals like that blue whale up or point ray is like you know juvenile it's like you're still sitting there like whoa I remember chatting with Asha DeVos one time about like how big is a blue whale right cuz that's like what she does her research yeah and when she was at UC Santa Cruz almost adult full-grown adult washed up in like in San Francisco somewhere and she went up there and she was like the whale was kind of on its side and so she's just like she felt like the hill was like towering over her dead on the beach you know she was just like it was it was still so mind-blowing to stand right next to it and not realize there's a few places luckily I know I don't want say the Cabrillo Aquarium back in LA a little aquarium of their habit they have like a top of either of blue or fin whales skull I think outside that my people can stand next to and I know the LA Natural History Museum has its bone warehouse but that's not open to the public so I wish more that was available to the public so people just the skeletons you know just what amazed people when Cheryl and I went to Penasco a couple years ago there's like this empty lot down by like the shopping area and there's fin whales in LA just sitting I was like okay so I just like sat on the fin whale skull so you could see how big it was yeah yeah there's certain places where just bombs every there's a taco place that has a gray well full articulate skeleton on like it's a roof yeah oh and duh right here over at Seymour centre long marine life skeleton so I just googled killer well scout school and it you can one you can buy one for a thousand dollars but to a northern right whale dolphin school is for sale for 300 bucks oh those replicas probably that company bone clones they make good stuff but anyways I want to show you what the northern right whale dolphin school kind of looks like common dolphin teeth oh wow that's really neat it's like a bird yeah doesn't look like one yeah I thought that'd be a bird if I you didn't tell me yeah I just think about it small fish yeah more teeth some more little teeth the better the actual number that's there's a couple hundred in there no I have 37 to fifty four pairs of small cone-shaped teeth in each dog that looks like more than that in there 37 to 54 pairs pairs so up to 180 Oh still looks like more what other famous whales you guys now remember patches oh I know patches yeah a certain California people know patches that's has been him honor ever no he's off Shores are no yeah a common thing here I thought I heard that it's been seen in San Francisco but I think it's San Diego I think I think they might have gone up there but probably pretty offshore in some warmer currents we just talked about iceberg the killer whale not that long ago cuz there was a sighting and Japan Japan Japan yeah there was that incident where they couldn't get any other cost that line Japanese were in the Russian waters they were well iceberg swam into Russian waters so the Japanese boat could not follow it find the whales music both sides researchers are stops there he's doing like what Batman does just exactly what I don't eat sure I just realized lot of our famous whales are miss colored whales Casper I feel cool that I've seen that one twice yeah again and not just like in a week but like once you know in 2000 I think it doesn't anything was a good year for we saw what kind of like four or five times yeah yeah I haven't seen yeah well you ever seen a lot hey every letter backs later it's funny because one time maybe two times one time for sure I was on the water uh-huh but we were with BBC filming for Blue Planet 2 and they were like nope it's not part of the storyline we don't want to go look at it I was like but it's so interesting they were like so did that's me and I want to see a tufted puffins they said well it's not a way from God and I was really just like please my eyes please one bias we were looking for common dolphins instead and I was like this is lame so iceberg oh yeah Oh JJ the gray whale oh did we talk about I feel like we talked about that during I think briefly yeah well season yeah great well what art great well JJ was a great well 1996 was it a Kaffir no yeah as a cabin that calf that was found rolling in the surf that had lost its mom off the coast of San Diego thing yeah and then they brought it into SeaWorld SeaWorld yeah and they actually kept her for 14 months yeah and raised it up and let it go yeah and so cool yeah they want to keep track of JJ but the how long did it last like not even not even I think I hit the water fell off he was there when they drop in the water yeah Studies on her to get a bunch of metabolic information from her while she was in captivity and he was there the day they released her and he saw the guys trying to mount the satellite tag because they put anchor pins in her back to mount the tag with like a couple weeks before hoping it would heal it closed and like hold a dinner energy like a piercing body yeah and he saw them like pick up the anchor pieces and they were not healed over and they just he's sure they just slipped right out as soon as she went and water yeah you know like I just realized that you really think about lobbies Wells her famous I mean they really do bring attention yeah animals right now rather was talking about it there's that humpback in Alamitos right now mmm toward San Francisco pretty far inland they say it's not looking too good but every time they they should put a picture in the paper its breaching or its guys head out of the water yeah this is almost the exact situation yeah exactly you can still never heard of it you never heard I'm gonna buy you the book I'm not reading it I'll read it to you even the kids book you won't read second when the tide changed and then he came in again he came back twice yeah he went way up the river yeah way so I had like a little kids book that like talked about how the boats were like coaxing him back into the ocean after he was refloated and yeah you can still find this kids book yeah especially in the Bay Area in fact you know just I should have bought it you know that antique mall over here cannery row yes you know how it's obviously a lot of locals will dump their stuff there someone had the newspaper clipping when he left the bay I was like oh when I was a kid yeah you know who actually worked with Humphrey and like has recordings of him lots of photos and videos of him is Tom Kiekhaefer over it oh yeah the whales yeah he talks about during their school programs in the area they they have a little section about Humphrey the humpback and stuff it's hackle so speaking of like newspaper clippings another whale I followed like religiously when I was a kid was Keiko oh yeah everyone knows Keiko yeah Keiko aka Willi yeah free tell everyone the story about cake Mexico Mexico and is Icelandic killer whale that was out of marine park in Mexico and he was not doing very well health-wise he had like a really bad skin rash and he was underweight and he just he really wasn't doing well and the facility didn't know what to do with them so the Oregon Coast Aquarium somehow goddddd in their heads one that this whale was available in - the thing wanted it so they renovated their facility and trucked him from Mexico to Oregon in a container truck but I thought was fascinating and people would line up on the highway and like have their little parade as he went by that's why I thought it was so interesting my mom did look at the newspaper all the people were lined up on the road when the whale went by in a car and funny and not funny when he comes to the Oregon Coast Aquarium his skin condition cleaned up really well and he gained a lot of weight and so they started to work with him more he was used in the movies for free Willy and then I think in the first free will you can still see the skin irritation er yes you can yeah because he was still getting over it yeah you can and then when his skin condition cleared up they started to see if they could like put live prey in his pen and what he would do with it and he got interested in it and would actually catch it so then they started to think maybe we can put this whale back in the wild like maybe he's a sea pen candidate and so they ended up doing that I think off the coast of Norway that I think it was up there somewhere North Atlantic yeah yeah that's where he was captured there right yeah and then they would like take him out do walks they'd like take him out in the boat and have him follow the boat around and like take him out of his pen and then they were hoping that he would start to like acclimate to the environment and then maybe hear other killer whales in the area and one day I think one day he saw killer whales and was kind of interested in it but they didn't go for it and then another day he saw killer whales and just like went with the pod and so they were like bye good luck but he ended up dying not that long he ended up coming like still coming back to people yeah I'm the final days he was still um there was a pretty good documentary on it right I just said just don't recall where I saw it yeah they showed the whole rehabilitation process and still to this day a lot of controversy because so you know people are always talking about releasing things and the proper steps to take and they're like oh you know Keiko was a waste of money he did it all wrong so it's still contracted pneumonia which a lot of captive whales contract and died from but you know how much more enriching was his life but that movie itself and Keiko I mean think about its how many kids it's inspired you talk to like every naturalist deckhand out there even some captains like that was a kid even if they don't want to admit it speaking of captivity Canada and cetacean captivity yes they did so there's no more dolphin to dolphins and captain so what are they gonna do a Vancouver Aquarium with like Chester and stuff I think I'm gonna I'm gonna assume what it means it or something there - I'm not sure what's left there probably what's gonna happen with if there's any marine parks that have animals I'm gonna assume they just can't breed anymore which and no more acquisition I thought they already did that they already said that they couldn't breathe in captivity anymore and somehow they keep everyone ester actually passed away I remember talking to one of our Canadian buddies about that I'm not sure what's still left over having Coover so maybe just no new acquisitions and what they have I know it's no breeding yeah and then another thing that happened in the Pacific Northwest was that so they wanted to call seals and sea lions and that was it didn't pass oh good yeah my opinion is if you have to kill predators to balance the prey we're managing the prey yeah exactly the humans are taking too much no we need to yeah let things go so what about some other famous whales speaking of northwest granny I never saw a granny rest in peace yeah I got to see her you know she's a little female I just remember looking for that dorsal fin is a perfect perfect like almost like a pert a human bite mark around the middle back of her dorsal yeah in fact that was one a few times that bite mark it does look like that it's like a personal is like a person's bite my body never the first time I saw her yeah it was pretty much all of j-pod just like heading into Canada I remember some of my father's have the Canadian flag in the background yeah how cool is it the first time you see the residence were they like in a line like the trailers and like they were pretty much we're like side-by-side I remember looking at one photo parade yeah yes it's just like one frame you're looking you count it you count like twelve dorsals in here I hope I get to see the resident in September I hope so too fun that'd be good for you that'd be really good trip guys got to see residents yeah what about some other the residents are pretty famous actually it's all Pacific Northwest I mean yeah cuz that's where the captive industry worked right so yeah moby doll yep moby doll had a cool story yeah she was shot with harpoon you guys know this and well she was shot with a harpoon uh-huh and then well it wasn't a she but that comes later so and then she survived and so they were like well we'll just keep it in a tank and they put it in captivity they put it they put it well they put in a pin I think in a Cove right uh-huh and then I don't know I forget how long they kept it but isn't that crazy she first off she survived a harpoon yeah and then lived and for stuff like why would you think that'd be a good one oh this car probably somewhere in the back right yeah I guess it lasted quite a while but then it ended up dying and they and they thought it was from like just some sort of you know disease yeah that's required ended up being once they did like the autopsy on her wasn't legit was a they found a bullet in her so it was not only shot with our opinion it had been shot with a bullet before that probably yeah but she was that our heat and then so ended up being so obviously once they had in captivity they were able to look at it and they found out that it was a male mm-hmm and then what's call that was the second whale that was captured actually mm-hmm and then the first one what was named Moo yeah yeah and that one didn't last very long either right no name it was in a sea pen for a while and it was it didn't he only go on display one day I don't know sure I think it was like only one day or something with that that book that was later I know is crazy that's a good book it's so much history because most of us are so used to bio bio bio this is more you know history yeah no it's really that's why I like it I think mystery and it's not super Sayan see exactly it's just like all the things that took place and with killer whales yeah humid it's good to have a different point of view every now and then that's why I can't wait to finish it there's like four other famous killer whales that end up in captivity on my license Lita Corky Lolita and Shamu yeah there have been many iterations of shamon yeah they keep on changing those names I think I told you guys where they came up with Shamu right namu yeah making the girls to put SH in front of it and then Corky they yeah they keep on reusing these names Corky I mean was actually the original court he actually passed away they always yeah just give him a new name Corky - it's a a pod killer well yeah that is so alive this I want to say the the second Corky is in a kid seeing Corky and or key or a one version of him when I was a kid in marine land I grew up over there yeah or ketu was caught a year before Corky yeah and then they lived in the same Marine Park for 17 years I remember a story is it in this book at all Slater Orakei and quirky were held in the same facility and they were starving for like months because they were oh it was an imam an assassin or so it was a male and a female and one yeah okay so they don't say they don't call it by or King Corky but basically what was happening is it won it was they were transients yeah and what happened was they weren't eating they were trying to feed it Sam yeah yeah and so they wouldn't eat it for like I don't know how long it was I can't there's more than die and usually when things like this happened the mom is the one that like forces the you know the kids to eat and so actually what happened was the male brought it over brought the oh I forget what fish it was but brought it over to the mom and then they both went down to the bottom and split it in half and and they ate it but it's not cool that the male grass I mean it's sad but yeah and then they and then he went back grabbed more and brought it down to her kept doing that and they kept eating yeah I remember whoever was telling me the story was like their ribs were visible at this point like they didn't eat within the next few days they were toast geez yeah and then that's when they were like wow they're way more complex than we thought and then they got like super sad about it because they're like this is crazy that that's sharing you know you're the other one maybe it was maybe it wasn't that talk maybe it was Ric O'Barry film or something he talked about it or something flipper the bottlenose dolphin he says no they talk about Ric O'Barry in the book yeah yeah and they talk about Ken Malcolm they talk about a lot of them a lot of the researchers or conservationists yeah so flipper the bottlenose dolphins another famous whale cetacean was it actually where was their is in Miami or something Florida there was quite a few flippers originally it really it was in the show I don't know about before that there was one original will be interesting I love that movie I mean no matter what I'm always gonna live there you go he says the movie again SpaghettiOs and he he burns his toast on the wall so me and Slater always always always discussed this every time we bring up flipper to the younger generation flippers a show well it was it was a you know all the generations to show the newer generations it's a movie yeah so I was like I like the movie flipper and then I told them about the newer show version that had Jessica Alba and then no one believed me I was like no Jessica Alba lives in the flipper show it's like what I swear from Australia Jack the Rizzo's dolphin Jack was actually let me think where he was from was it New Zealand I think that was yeah New Zealand yeah where's me I think P said that hey tell us about Jack I don't speak New Zealand yeah I'm saying it right what's this sea lions name in Cabo oh the one that steals fish all the time don't want it yeah then come back a boat while they're driving and like sits there Carlos or something I don't know yeah but there's a lion that I mean it's not the best thing it actually yeah but I New Zealand dolphin is Raziel dolphins pretty popular too in my macho macho is a poncho yeah he like grabs Dorado like there's a video of him yeah did you find thing in that Jack yeah jack the resist dolphin you say old sea captain said he used to escort them yeah Cook Strait in New Zealand which was like really sketchy to navigate from the years 1888 to the years 1912 they have records of saying that this dolphin guided them into the harbour which is pretty interesting and Rizzo's dolphins can definitely be identified as individuals they're very recognizable so he was known for escorting ships into Cook Street there was shot yes you know for someone aboard the SS Penguin tried to shoot Jack with a rifle despite the attempt on his life Jack continued to help ships folklore saying however that Jack no longer helped the SS penguin into the harbour and wrecked in 1909 in Cook Strait the curse of Jack is over oh and he was one of the first cetaceans to be protected by law because of that so following the shooting incident a law was proposed to protect Jack and he became protected by the order-in-council under the sea Fisheries Act in 1904 Oh another well we should definitely bring up you mentioned the name but we forgot to actually talk about her Lalita yes and her real name she's a yeah yes I want them to release her with in my isn't her mom still alive yeah yeah there's family I still live that way I think she would be a good release candidate she's so she's a rapture there there was she's in the pen is Pacific white-sided dolphins isn't she at Miami Seaquarium I think she shares the pool with dolphins well I mean technically she won't need them either way no the Dolphins wouldn't be afraid of her if they could if they had lived in the wild too and knew what a resident was scary yeah but they always show what do you guys think how do you feel about that would you want her to be released I think she'd be cool like I mean I don't know if her health was proved good enough which I heard the last time someone went to Miami Seaquarium that his observed dirt sounds like her house declining but if she was healthy enough to go out into the wild I think she should but it has to be like she has to be acclimated you know yeah yeah it's not like you know you're free we make her a seat man like somewhere in the Pacific Northwest right yeah then keep her there for like um maybe a couple weeks then when l-pod comes by after they're done hanging out Monterey again then you slip into that pod so that's the tricky thing how do you do that you just like I'm off to concerns because one we don't really have a good read on where el pods been going the last few years like especially since that last whale died from having that dorsal tag on because they're one of the ones that roamed the coast a lot based on the satellite tag data the other thing is the prey situation the food situation like oh yeah who would feed her yeah I mean she probably could still figure out how to capture live food because she was like raised up there and if you really think about this they might bring her food though it's so dire right now yeah that is that even fair exactly exactly just like I said do we want to put her in that situation you're right maybe I don't because one it's like one more mouth to feed and she probably gets fed away better not being yeah you know I mean in this particular situation yeah overall we've all spoke our piece about how we feel no activity but I don't think it's fair to put her out there right now with the way the situation is true what yeah all right change my mind okay and it's yeah I just later scientists very very difficult yeah it's it's a heart you know it's a really heartbreaking situation like I wish we had it would be a cool story though right I can't have him she joins l-pod she actually says hey the Salmons right here and then we could make up we can't make a new well movie about it yeah there's another famous killer well Luna that's a sad story too ones have died I mean obviously we we have our usual humpback whales over here Wednesday they're fantasy they're like chompers and Blackberry my friend over here you know and train wreck Angry Birds and oh and I've seen it I feel like for sure one time but I think two times both times I want to say that on the counter on the way to Catalina bottle-nosed officer borrows often with one common dolphin oh yeah yeah yeah we're out on the boat I probably even know about cameras in we get where it's just like that have you seen scarback I know you have have you seen Scott oh yeah yeah yeah so we've all seen scarback the gray well okay wait why would they have a common dolphin no they hold a cafe all right Eli got lost and they picked it up like come here friend you need no no I just needed maybe companionship is it oh well we caught that one I still think that's really cool few weeks ago we had that humpback and everyone noticed it for a few days we had a lone bottlenose hanging out a lot back yeah yeah it was really cool but together it was just one bottle now so I couldn't believe it we talked about that for sure yeah we did okay so now what do you guys want to say asses are back scarback yeah she's a very famous whale she feeds off of the coast of Oregon and Depoe Bay where they pulled the mice at shrimp off the kelp there and she has a asymmetrical wound on her back they think from an exploding harpoon so scar back is a good example that I talked to people about how there's whales alive day that lived through whaling and yet still are very Boat tolerant like star back it has close encounters with those little zodiacs up in deep obey like fairly often like once or twice a season show like have a pretty close encounter with a boat and she seems to be okay with it I think she did she have a calf or she was presaged the first time I think I ever talked to you I messaged you on Facebook because you had a drone video oh you're asking for your probably for your for Jim yeah because she looks really wide might be pregnant so they think it was an exploding harpoon and the reason why they think that is because I know the last people to have exploding our booms was in Russia I think though they were the last people to use she so they Jim thinks that she stays off the Oregon coast because she physically cannot migrate the full migration so she may have been a Russian great yeah that may have been an East Pacific gray whale before then but she cannot make that big journey anymore because she does have some debilitation from the injury that's interesting yeah I never thought of it that way yeah I want to say my dad seen a southbound yeah I've never seen the same whales twice northbound northbound great whale migration so scattered like it happens in such a long drawn-out phase thank you specially s heard in Southern California we do have some that especially there in southbound a lot of people don't think I mean we always know our gray whales as coastal whales but they'll go back there behind behind Catalina the first part of the migration we're like going like 10 or 11 miles out like we always say so straight out and then eventually because they come in along the island and then they Bend again right at Dana Point yeah so like Newport kind of gets like dusted on the first part of that migration that's kind of like Santa Cruz on the southbound migration right like they're pretty widely scattered coming down past the farallon's and then they funnel in at point-p nose cuz there's kind of like to bend in the coastline there too how many like it's crazy because how many passed away this year but we saw there was days in the beginning of migration that was like 45 it was like 60 whales in two hours yeah yeah as I'm saying it was nuts there's a lot of great whales I'm just wondering if the populations are gonna just kind of be shuffled up but we're gonna see increases in that Pacific feeding group you know wonder if the whales are gonna catch on yeah hey there might be better food here you know I mean the ocean conditions the last five years have just been so out of whack in the guest areas like anything goes at this point so we'll see how it goes you guys know any other famous wheels if you have a famous Oh funghi we talked about funky with Eva the audio is kind of mess yeah so funky is a dolphin that scene around the Dingle Peninsula in Ireland and oh yeah like in his forties I think he's a bottlenose dolphin and he showed up decades ago by himself and he used to like people could swim out from the harbor and swim with him yeah he used to be like super tolerant now I mean he'll you see him with the boats almost every day but he's like they say he's actually he was telling me about funky yeah yeah that's good yeah if you guys know other ones send them to us we'd love to hear about him I think that kind of stuffs really interesting yeah oh you know who forgot about winter oh yeah the bottlenose yeah did you watch that movie dude one and two yeah I saw it on that I saw it on the plane actually I think the second one I saw has a good movie yeah Morgan Freeman's in it right prosthetic flukes a movie Morgan Freeman is usually a pretty good movie dude like Bruce Almighty Evan Almighty they're good movies all right we're certainly Shaq away this is when we have to end the podcast we can talk about well movies well movies well maybe that'll be another topic we should just do well movies even though we when your finger you finish your book we're gonna do well book reviews you know yeah there are some good ones out there but yeah if you know other famous whales or dolphins send them to us it's always fun to hear about that kind work any other topic matters do you want to yeah yeah send us some topics you guys I feel like we've been just doing a lot of trip reports and stuff lately and just some random guests here and there but we'd love to hear some more topic ideas we're gonna end this

hello everyone and welcome back to the well nerds podcast this is episode number 26 my name is Slater and I'm here with Eric and Katelyn hey everyone hello and I just shut the window because it's freezing oh you guys I was gone for like five days mm-hmm and on all five of those days you guys saw like the craziest stuff ever yeah let's see started with me leaving on Friday in the morning yeah and halfway down the coast I'm headed to LA and about halfway I get a text message are you with the killer whales right now and I look on social media and I see all the stories of people with killer whales you know and Caitlin works on Fridays yeah dude you missed out what the Freak did you see I don't even want to tell you because you upset oh yeah you're already upset - I'll tell you oh yeah well here's the thing actually we almost messed it up so we were watching some humpbacks and some dolphins out west and then Eric and company up north were like oh we have the 50 ones and I was like oh shoot we better go up there and so we were watching this humpback and we're like oh there's like three Rizzo's in front of it we'll look at these and then we'll go so we turn and leave oh they were not results so this other boat was like oh hey these are killer whales and we were like no they're not they're three Rizzo's nope we were wrong it was three killer whales who's just three so then we followed the three killer whales for a little while and this other boat is like oh we see in a male down here and I was like okay well keep track of that and then um the three were kind of going Northwest I was like alright well maybe they'll meet up with the 50 ones but it was like a lot of boats just trying to follow three killer whales and so we just went down to that other group we never really did see a male but then we get down to the other group and it's like three or four females and juveniles in the mail hanging around somewhere out in the distance and out of nowhere we're like okay they're down on dive we'll wait there's one killer whale jumps like 15 feet in there I was like no one got right no definitely - full body links in the air before it started to crest and come back down I was like oh my god - full body length of 60 feet Caitlin of a killer whale 25 way of the highest I've ever seen it was like a male killer Oh max is like what 30 feet at the most mmm 25 oh there's there's some document at 31 yeah yeah see science documentation do you know I'm not joking though it was like well over 10 feet in the air it was crazy none of us got a photo of it of course because we were not expecting it really go we're gonna start timing their dive and then this one just flies out even yeah even Duke you know since that's as high as he's ever seen one fly out oh yeah he's been on the walk that one picture that goes around on Instagram it's like you don't know what's a crazy and I can do this on Ted or something yeah I know real life so I don't know why I want to hear about your guys's trips I don't hear about it you're trying to figure out this is how I feel every frickin podcast okay so get over it so then we're trying to figure out what they're doing and all of a sudden I see a Pacific white-sided dolphin so like oh well then we're watching and they're chasing around this dolphin there's two dolphins so I don't know how they got these two unaware if they were just kind of like a small group wandering around but they're chasing two Pacific white-sided dolphins and then they end up losing one and then they hit this other one out of the water like four or five times and then they lose it and they run for like a mile and the dolphin got away they killed that one no they didn't even kill the dolphin oh I bet it died later it's out there somewhere with a gnarly backache cuz they got hit pretty hard I saw it in your picture dang so you're telling me they didn't even kill him no they didn't even kill it did you see any predation that day I know were you out yeah I think that was the day actually what happened was us leaving for Moss Landing we actually had the CA fifty ones and they were I think that day man honestly this last few days have been so amazing I'm kind of confusing the accountants I think that was the day we actually saw him go after a sea lion and then you know we were watching them and you know we called everyone in and moss landing boats obviously got to enjoy him but then you know we called the Monterey boats and yeah you guys on your boat I actually had something for the people down south so both both fleets got to see different pods of killer whales so that day was pretty amazingly pretty neat to have that get that feeling that you know that these animals are plentiful in our Bay yeah it was the group that we had I didn't recognize any of the whales and it sounds like it might be whales that are not seen very often and it was one whale that you did recognize right no I never saw the mail some people think it was fat fin but I never actually saw him so I don't know okay so it's so unconcerned I haven't seen any photos but some people were thinking there was two males I only saw one it could have been two two different times like I don't know but we never we took off and followed the mom and calf chasing the dolphin and the male kind of like followed us but we were more focused on them and so we didn't even really get good looks at them okay okay but yeah yeah this deployment plain and simple we've had crazy amount of killer whale activity here in the bay to the point that Slayer was losing his mind we had a few rare visitors to that showed up it was so rare Hey look you know I was at a graduation a couple birthdays and Father's Day yeah I mean family's important well one of the rarer parts of show up was it was Adams I'd like to call Adams pod now in honor guess what I got to see them yeah you can finally got this handle we're not there yet no so what happened so that's Friday what happens how today it was the CA 51 so basically I'm looking my records like I'm saying it's like I'm losing track of let's just say since the beginning of the month I personally has seen them on June 8 June 9 June 13th June 14th today so fifty ones that have been yeah all the fifty ones what day did you see the blue oh is that Sunday the 16th the Sun yeah six people is a blue well that was a neat sighting too I was weird yeah we had a single blue whale then we saw what appeared to be humpbacks in the distance multiple animals but they were moving at a high rate of speed and are taking a long dive so we kind of got frustrated so we told our passengers okay we'll try for one more good book we got up there next thing you know it's three blue whales moving at a high rate of speed towards the north toward Santa Cruz so that was our blue whale moment but no no I don't want say none of stuck around just that we've been so lucky with that the the killer whale has no one's really gone off short it really mm-hmm explore more yeah so the day that we followed on Friday when we followed the killer whales a long ways with the dolphin we ended up seeing a humpback when the killer whale slowed down and turned to go back to the main group and so we kind of just let them go do their thing because they really needed to rest because they had just done like a really big long chase so we let him peel off and we saw this humpback so then we kept following it out and we were like way out at like the Oh 607 line so well beyond the edge of the canyon and all sudden we stumbled across like 15 humpbacks and dolphins so maybe everything's just further offshore right now and we're just not getting all the way out there to see it or what's going on but we did find a pretty big group of humpbacks feeding out there and a lot of bait there's so much bay in the bay there's a lot of it yeah since I've been back man they're just huge and they're not little schools they're like huge yeah like that one we saw today with you yeah today we had some really big bait balls and mackerel chasing the anchovies and stuff it was good cool stuff all right so uh Monday I came back you were on your way home that's when those oh yeah so Monday those rare transients were here yeah and who saw them yeah I saw them it was the t-34s and t37 days and t37 and yeah it was another one of those moments where you know some knowledgeable people were around and just staring on go ahead three boats around us at least and we're all looking on going he's don't look familiar you know what could really figure it out and then you know eventually we're kind of got out that that were visitors from a more secret frequently seen farther up north I want to say that before our particular sighting the last sighting of any of these particular individuals of further south was around the border of Oregon and California I think I want to say Crescent City years weren't they decided up there a few days ago yeah so we've gotten a lot of visitors from the Pacific Northwest into this into this area so fascinating what a weird season it's been so far like I'm hoping that June and July are like killer well it was slow for killer whales because the gray whale migration was such a struggle then we've had like three out-of-town royal site sightings to hit l-pod you guys had northern like Pacific Northwest transients on your all day trip yeah yeah and then we've had these ones a couple days ago yeah so bizarre oh it's gonna be a good killer well season I mean I was explaining to past meters all afternoon today you know normally we see him two or three times a month in the office of quote-unquote offseason which is the whole rest of year except for mid-april to mid-may and then we've seen him like eight or nine times this but yeah June which is normally really slow I'll take it except for don't do it while I'm off yeah it's gotten to the point where yeah actually yeah it's been confusing because we've seen them so much but it seems like a lot of these events that we've had those specific nose tees we didn't see any this events but most of the other times we witness them they were actually going after sea lions and we've seen a few successful hunts out there so definitely eating showing signs of good health today let's talk about today first of skipping Tuesday bro oh yeah so Tuesday was my first day back you were off huh if you want a boat duh yeah you are I was with you it's right here that was snowing Bret okay so Tuesday we had the ca1 twenty-twos but not 122 yeah and also the 50-50 one ace and 50 B and 50 B yeah and you saw him kill a seedling and well we left the sea lion and it was hiding up against a boat home and then we left but yeah anyways that was a great encounter huh no he's a mate they went Pat they went they made close encounters like all the boats they chased a sea lion or actually you know so weird is they passed the sea lion I see no I totally like skipped out of the water and then they kept going and then they circled way way back to it like they left it for a while faked it out yeah or they found a new one I can't I can't remember you're letting it think it got away and then they just crushed it yeah yeah well they didn't know they like didn't even hit it for so long so weird they were teaching the little ones maybe but it was a really good good encounter they la though close passes like they came right under our boats their passengers I just look down yeah heads yeah heads high out of the water all the time tons of tail slaps it was ridiculous like three like you would see three flukes out of the water at once yeah that's cool and then oh yeah we saw three slaps all at one time they did me they even traveled well I mean Slater got some good actually porpoises like traveling at a decent speed and like paralleling us kind of and then just like porpoising though and they're like occasional like really high like we're almost looked like they were breaching yeah so that was really cool and then today just kidding Caitlin was on the boat with me in the morning and we had oh it's kind of a weird morning we had northern right whale dolphins Pacific white-sided dolphins and some humpback whales and everything was really like she's kind of weird they were they were kind of like not picking a direction being really unpredictable sometimes they'd really pick up speed and then they slow down and they weren't really feeding though we'd go buy Bay pawpaw after bait ball and they would not stop and feed the biggest babe all of our life really now I was like there it's gotta just lunch you right in the middle and nothing yeah that's weird yeah and then we kind of were like well maybe there's some killer whales around Earth I knew and then after noon also because the day before we had killer well sometimes I feel like any time we have too little is the next day they ain't almost not show that way yeah so sure enough though right as we're like probably 30 minutes from the dock killer real excited you know just had a moss landing and I was like are we gonna get him on the next one yes boom Caitlin stay cold Eric and Eric came down yeah and we got to see them this evening we all got to go on the boat together yeah that's rare hey usually often you're there yeah yeah me or Eric not me and Eric mm-hmm yeah so that was awesome and would they do this afternoon I'll chicka wow wow oh yeah they look like they were trying to make some little girls played some Barry White there was what nine nine because I got six and then I got three on the Joneses nine yeah there's the fifty ones and I'm not sure who else I don't think I don't think it was the one well okay so I saw Orion and I saw bumper and there was another male I have a feeling it was a 51 age wait wait that wouldn't make me I think that was 50 B yeah and it would've been another one no I don't know who it was I don't know the 138 it's that they saw the David or 51 days is five and fifty bees with them plus four is nine uh but I don't think that was 50 V I didn't take any photos with my camera today I only did and see if we can figure out who it is but there was definitely some male display happening and there was lots of what do you mean by that and their favorite though Eric Michael was out what Eric saw that killer whales penis and he was definitely very enthused about it all right you just said that really awkward this is what I was you want to notice that big pink floyd-- yeah science you yelled it from the back of the boat I was like thank you for that so basically there's been tons of killer whales so there are a lot of killer whales around you're more likely to get like mating behavior well dude how many different pods 122 like 122 line the see if you want yeah there's possibly four or five pods in the bay right yesterday I don't know who they are and then those trans teens from the Northwest yeah I wonder if any remember just offshore and they can they know they're near yeah I think they I mean you tend to see them set their 's one sighting then it's likely that you're gonna see him again the next day I think I hope tomorrow my opinion is the stats of being able to see them like the second day is way higher did you know it's so funny think about this I bet when they're in like the bay right now like all nine of them and you we didn't see anything in afternoon there was like that one humpback but the humpbacks aren't really scared of those like totally the opposite direction from where we left from but think about how funny it is that like when they're in the bay do you think they realize like wait what everybody go except for like a few straggling sea lions that's just like how the how they live their life though they're just like used to the ocean clear yeah I know that's funny to think about huh they really be friends to like wow these humpbacks they just hate us we won't just want to be their friend yeah I think I've seen uh who was it George or someone went out like and he went up to the humpbacks we're like we took a selfie with George that day yeah he was traveling down the coast and he like went over to humpback Grove it was like pretty much pretty much no there was a parallel Miss Georgia on one side and then humpbacks on the other side and they were all both simultaneously moving down their coast yeah remember that day yeah it was me you and Tyler I've seen comic breach on top of the humpback Wow yeah they were like the Sun back was mugging him like normal and bumper and comet were like harassing this humpback whale and then comet just like breached on top of it one thing there's a lot of calves with these yeah well Northwest transients had a little teeny tiny baby right like still really yeah orange II colored so did one of the whales yesterday but it wasn't super yeah it wasn't that it was orange yeah well it was a pretty young one in there today - that's which is why I don't think it's the 51 a scause I didn't think she had a calf that little mm-hmm I thought it was bigger right now so I'm not convinced as 51 days from today no still not sure but still trying to verify ahmadies that there's so many pictures so it's been really good months so far yeah June has been an excellent month already which is I mean I don't know what I go back and forth about June like June's not my favorite month in Monterey but this June has been pretty good yeah well the humpbacks kind of all left that's why yeah so there was there wasn't exotics then there are killer whales yeah I looked at our logs yeah last last summer we last June I should say we didn't have this this is amazing yeah exactly been a year Bros mm-hmm if we hadn't found if we hadn't had that report of the dolphins this morning though man that would've been a slim picking trick cuz it took us like over an hour to find that first humpback yeah we definitely passed a few though I remember that one I think never came back up yeah there was definitely Wells but nothing was showing yeah yeah it was a qdubs yeah I mean when we do see humpbacks it's been like single ones recently many that's kind of like they just like go around I feel like they check in to Monterey Bay they eat a little bit then they want to go cruise a coast and see what else is going on and then they come back yeah it got to go survey all their options yeah rumor has it there's a good clump towards the farallon's krill yeah krill but it just happened cuz there was like this access cruise with Monterey Bay and erna all the sanctuaries I think they took the Fulmar up there or something and they went through like two weeks ago and they saw nothing and then like last week we heard that report from the boats going out to the Farallones oh there's lots of humpbacks out here so just like instantly happened come back this way come back this way I'll be back they always come back alright you guys just quote Scarface what I did all right all right [Laughter] why our little killer whales orange oh gosh people been asking this question like every day that's okay there's a couple different reasons right our ideas are Katie's yeah we're you guys one is that when they're young like that they don't have a big blubber layer built up so you can kind of see their blood vessels through or what yeah that's yeah that's one theory okay what's other one that they're John yeah but every single killer whale calf has that well I mean a lot of human common in infants too I was yellow okay but I'm still yellow but oh she hit me she okay she physically hit him okay so anyways whatever though I mean little orange killer whales you know like oh speaking of little orange killer whales and and and where was I San Juan Islands Thank You that guy goes it's like a little cheeto it was really some of the orange coloration comes from diatoms too sometimes when you see that you see that on any whale but that's not necessarily just like one exclusive thing for juvenile killer whales yeah I saw I saw a common of that on Facebook that they're saying is diatoms but it diatoms look some way I mean all baby killer whales and we think about it's a pod they travel together same there they will all have diatoms yeah that's like the antarctic killer whales they all have died not yeah but yeah actually most of them do yeah yeah so they go and do like these skin maintenance migrations to get the diatoms in the dead skin off because they they do get pretty well coated down there so they like go up to the subtropics for like three or four days and then they come back all right you guys so do you see the killer whale video going around where the killer well they're swimming with it I don't know where it's at it's really clear blue water and then it circles the guy and like stops and like you can see it's a clicking and stuff or you can hear it and then really then it comes back why that guy that has the camera oh it's underwater footage he doesn't see it no it's really cool so is it on the Facebook certainly anyways it's bullets everywhere but anyways that video or someone messaged the well nerds the person's name is Danny and she asked a cool question Eric gave us a good topic and it's to swim or not to swim with cetaceans in the wild what do you guys think while I look for this video I think if you do it in a respectful way it's not a big deal it's kind of like well watching right like from a boat as long as you're not you know harassing the animals by like you're being respectful you're following them in safe ways and you okay so like if you have to run up on top of the whale jump in front of it and to get a look at it underwater right but if you're able to just park the boat slip into the water without like making a huge spike into that even with the well sharks they make you just slide in because you don't want to spook them yeah slide into the water and then slowly like paddle out away from the boat obviously so you're not bringing them close to the boat and then if they come to you that's like I feel like that's yeah I know pretty proper to me yeah I mean I think any cetacean can get away from a human being if I wanted to I think we're just not that good of a swimmer compared to them how is that with the Marine Mammal Protection Act because there's different types of harassment right like there's a little B or does the a B and C something like that yeah so I wonder if you're not harassing is it technically not illegal I think another thing they always say is modifying behavior too you know yeah if you're not changing the behavior of the animal so I guess if you go in the water and they sticking around in the area I mean that's not obviously modifying behavior yeah I'm not saying I don't want people to jump in the water anyways because their boats and theirs it's not even just the whales it's a lot of other things that swim with dolphins program in Hawaii that came under scrutiny and like pretty much all of them have been shut down now is with the spinner dolphins a lot of times they were just like dumping the snorklers like right in front of the dolphins that are trying to sleep and so that I'm like okay that seems like not really responsible but if they happen to go by you while you're in their area that's fine but like day after day after day you're just like passing off snorkelers and I've seen a lot of the dolphins on purpose then that's not I guess if they're dumping her in front of them but yeah I feel like I see so much footage I came from why were they swimming up and right past the people too so I don't think it was always a negative no I think there was a flying companies that were like really not doing it responsibly which is why they came out there's so much scrutiny and because just because they're sleeping you guys know that they can travel sleep breach Andy I feel like almost you know maybe not eaten but they can do a lot of stuff while sleeping right yeah it's just like it's one more stressor you know like if you're not doing it responsibly and then the animals trying to rest yeah they can do all kinds of stuff while they're resting but like do they have to yeah but do you also feel like if they wanted to take it is they could leave too yeah so I'm not saying that you should mess with the sleeping in well I'm just saying I'm just I think if you do it responsibly and you're being really respectful of the whales I don't think I think it's foolish to think that we're gonna do anything that's super detrimental to them because like they totally could get away from you yeah also sometimes like they could mess you up and also it seems like the places where it's done more often Tonga Dominican Republic I mean you got you know some guides out there who actually will watch the people and make sure they don't do anything stupid most of them you know are following guidelines not to you know bother the animals and even the passenger is making sure they don't bother the animals and I think they're looking out for well behaviors because the humpback specially in Tonga or in any other breeding grounds yeah if they start to get active so our Peck sloppy you know the way they usually move the people out get water because you know they can breach in like a second which people there's totally videos are they're breaching right next to people yeah she's not whales doing right next to me do you think they know exactly where like tip of their nose is gonna land I think yeah I think so yeah oh yeah calves okay juveniles and calves is a different thing yeah but like adults for sure there is there's a lot of video servicing of humpbacks breaching like 10 feet from boats like you don't even like that one in Alaska there's one somewhere else and it looks scary as heck but something like don't hit it someone said that that incident in front of Moss Landing yeah if you if you pre play that video you actually see the hump you know we all make mistakes the hump back really tries to change its body language a little bit in midair because it kind of like realize like oh it's someone something's next yeah and it only ended up hitting the tip of the kayak when originally before it like changed the roll it could have landed like the back of its head flat on those people yeah yeah I just talked to that guy about that Tom Tom yeah I interviewed him for a different project us he was like the kayaker mm-hmm he was just here on blue ocean right yeah yeah he's a whale detective story that he was doing about that incident trying to figure out you know like what whale breached on him comes out I think in the US and August did he find out the results if you're emember them saying they narrowed it down to what whales were feeding yeah they have like known they have like the suspect and then the known associates based on the happy whale stuff but the rest of the story I remember being on the boat with Ted and them saying like this they're like I remember seeing well and they're saying this one could be potentially it that's kind of cool things I guess he saw Fran the other day yeah friends back okay good for her I did see someone online saying that Fran they were like we saw Fran down here and she's a boy but don't they know that Fran's a girl yeah supposedly I think yeah a lot of people are saying friends a girl in fact they're always hoping for her offspring she is one of the humpbacks that I want to say she's second or third generation that showed up in the Monterey Bay Area her mom I've seen Fran with you and I've seen Fran with you yeah man pretty cool fans pretty indifferent years to like do I'm 16 in like 1880 yeah me and Eric had her breech tail slap tail throw yeah I route the point that was your phone background for a long time yeah that Luca with one of the other boats right to start or something yeah hmm yeah I watch her take naps a lot on a video she's so chill like she just hangs out right next to the boat and just sleeps she doesn't even care yeah but everyone's was waiting for her to come back and she's back but yeah I want to say she was one of the ones that has a family history of being out here yeah she's definitely cool well well back to that topic there swimming with cetaceans in the wild would you do it yes because okay they swim with them and all the other places I'm just saying if it was like clear water I don't know if I could do it in this green water and it was regulated and all they're like good stuff there was rules but like I feel like they just wouldn't stay in one place long enough for it to be oh you don't think they turn at you real quick and check you out maybe for like a second and then be like all right gotta go bye whatever to get it up for me I mean it's freaking cold dude am i wet too and then keep going yeah so do you say like what you're gonna get all that all that rigmarole get the seven mil wetsuit on because it's so frickin cold and then they're gonna just like buzzy once and then that's it my bumper sticks his tongue out at you man I mean I don't know cuz I feel like even when they are friendly with the boat like they move around so much that I feel like it would be so hard to see them I have a weird feeling that if someone got in the water with him they might stick around a little bit longer maybe come on how many people are swimming with the sea a fifty ones like if someone is swimming with them you don't think they'd turn in like two then again I've spent with bottlenose dolphins somewhere in the world and they they they came by for like a second yeah they don't even care I definitely turned though and I came back and then kept going cuz like with the humpbacks it's like it's moms and calves so they're resting like the moms sleeping a lot of the time and then you get to see the calf and then like they're just hanging out they're not moving but with killer whales like there's always on the go hmmm what do you think air good nice one were them uh you know if it's regulated I would definitely do it and I mean I haven't swam with cetaceans on purpose but I mean I've been to Florida with the manatees and stuff like that and yeah if you go with a reputable company that actually you know protects the animals watches the divers actually have guides in the water then I think that it is okay because I've personally watched the guides as I go you know go after and you scold people who are not practicing those you know the good ethics and stuff around the animals and the treatments and the animals out there and I also go to places where it's a lot quieter where the animals are you know being surrounded by two-minute yeah less people and stuff like that so I'm surprised we don't have any more like any swim with animals anywhere like not even know why I really like the humpbacks because it's like it's just like a us thing I think though because if those humpbacks if the Hawaiian Islands were anywhere else I feel like people would be swimming with them I don't know I mean did you you had pretty good weather the whole time you're in Hawaii I mean that's the other question I have is like what's the weather like in these places like when this starts blowing 1520 knots you can't swim with them anymore right like so how many days do you make how many days do you get good Sookie I don't know I think you go to sort like those humpbacks you could have swam with them dude they came right to the boat and we're like we're right underneath but I mean that was probably well I mean I've had them rubble about here but with the clear water I mean it was like an inch from the boat I'm not even joking so like the logistics of getting people in and out of boats depending on the sea conditions but all of us there are made for that all the most there do snorkel trips during the winter or the summer yeah well they do them during the winter as well I don't know I mean I'm I'll never say never like I'll probably try it sometime in my life it I'm going to talk about one day yeah yeah really Tonga is one of my dream trips but once again you know there you're watching the people a lot of the people out there it's their livelihood they're about protecting those animals you know I want you to have a good experience because their livelihood same thing with Baja you know we oh yeah we've all officially been there you put up pictures and people knock you I believe the whales alone and I always tell them don't say anything till you go there when a freaking gray whale brings her calf to you you know don't tell me I'm bugging the animal when it's bringing its calf to me you know you know all of these animals could get away exactly they can say oh hey come he can hold their breath for 20 minutes plus yeah all of them like I mean that's part of why I like would be you're saying with the transients I'm like dude they would immediately just like buy yeah if they've dropped to 20 feet in like a second and you know I'm not gonna go out with a company that's you know not legit and charging up on the animals you can get passengers on the boat like are we bugging the whales like yeah what do you want me to say why'd you even come on this trip if you think we are you know yeah why would you ask me that come on this trip you know I'm not gonna I love these animals and that's on here yeah people don't even realize to ask it until they're on the boat though and then they're like oh shoot people ask me all the time and I say the same thing is like look where we are we're in the open ocean you're watching normal behavior they're feeding they're right next to us they could we're in their home they can go any direction around us to leave this area you know you tell me when they don't want to be seen that fan was really good in boats too and they want when they're when they're over it dude well think about it they came right to us today and then out of nowhere they popped up like a quarter-mile away yeah so it's just like if they really wanted to leave it wouldn't even take them but like two minutes to be a mile away from us yeah yeah I wonder how far they can't get in mind these people don't see what we do behind the scenes I mean literally us three you know are in the works plus more fellow lil Watchers you know are doing stuff to protect these animals you know so it's just ridiculous people ask questions like that is like II think that many people and I mean 99% of us are not here to harm these animals or to take advantage of them or to get the closest look possible you know so we can look down their blowholes I don't get one day people ask me that question all the time don't we bugging them it's like I wouldn't be doing this if I was no but there is people that do bug them so yeah yeah so we're not saying that nobody does because they're I've seen people do it I saw someone do it in Baja and other company pissed and they called whoever they come yeah and then we've seen you know in other places in California yeah and sometimes it's just like a lack of education or like we're private like loving them to death to you know like you think that you're like having this amazing encounter with them and really you're like you're just like over loving them they're like whoa dude shut up and he said please with me yeah I know under certain regulations if you calculated and people have done it before me yeah for many years or need some experience some expertise and and some oversight and then you know if you're doing it responsibly sure I mean I mean it's its nature we're a part of nature you know and species interact yeah if we were if we don't have like boats and everything I mean we're just out of nature we would be swimming yeah you know to me yeah like in separate we're so civilized like with yeah boats and trains and cars and planes where we're in and we're an animal too so we're gonna we're gonna eventually gonna interact with our animals but you know obviously we should are the ones that think we know better so we should treat these animals better too with respect so random out of the blue thing so I remember we were talking about Fran but it's not two-generation she's actually her mom was River or big fin so Fran is the calf and she was her mom big fin used to hang out here in Amman right can you see how far Fran went down so I can see where I think it was like I think they see her done it um so Fran let's see the whales of gorilla project Wow yeah she said she's been down the mainland Mexico yeah yeah not nuts yeah way down south on the coast she she's been far down in 2014 and this Sutter and tip of mainland Mexico let me see if I can get an actual city soap you guys can have it like San Luis Potosi or something like that Jose really far yeah it's like basically Donal a hose from yeah it's kind of cool so one of the ladies that started the research project down there which is now pretty much entirely run by all the locals that live down there she's from Central California she she started that project with the intention of just handing it over to the locals once it was up and running which is pretty much it they're pretty much at that point now and yeah she's like oh yeah I know Fran she's like well watching with uh yeah so pretty much off of Acapulco there should work that's where as far as she has gone I'm not sure it's about the recent year how far she's gone but yeah she's been seen as far as with the cosine of another one that gets commonly cited down I think out of Cabo is Batman oh yeah yeah he's pretty well-known down there too is that man the one with oh yeah he's like got a piece missing out of the middle of one of his flew there was a well no I think about man I haven't seen ok good someone's seen that my recently died in the winter okay okay good it's like cat's paw or something or one another one he was hanging out pretty late into the summer too I remember seeing him in October I guess I keep on missing Batman but yeah I personally haven't seen Batman since I saw all the time does it say my name on there what I yeah your pictures right here so you have seen down there yes I saw the movies and I saw the whale oh my god alright you guys I think that's it for this podcast yeah once we start talking about random stuff that's not well we gotta wrap it up well we had an awesome week I feel like it's gonna continue all the way into the summer here in Monterey and I'm going out tomorrow who's gonna borrow it me me I'll be going out by that a moss landing sweet so we'll all be on the water tomorrow thank you guys so much for losing his podcast hope you enjoyed it if you don't follow us on Instagram it's well nerds we also have a patreon you can find a link to that on our Instagram and yeah thanks for listening

hello everyone and welcome back to the well nerds podcast my name is Slater and I'm here with Eric and Caitlyn hey everyone hello and this is episode number 27 and I just thought about something really crazy what so you guys know about the beluga whales that they shipped to Iceland for the sanctuary well I don't know their names but they shipped two beluga whales from captivity and they are in Iceland in a sanctuary yeah and I was thinking about this so when they fly these beluga whales in the plane is the pressure in the water change when they're way up high oh good question science all over you guys now what I think it does yeah well they're not like totally submerged in water the whole flight are they they're like kind of halfway in water Oh cuz they're in the sling a giant tank in the plane right but they gotta get they got it plus the water is heavy so I'm sure they put him in a sling and only put him in enough water to like keep him cooled off yeah so then they would feel the air pressure cuz they're in the cargo hold well if they were coming from anywhere in North America it's like a 11 hours well I guess it's there on the East Coast it's only like a six hour flight Daesan but from here almost eight hours or nine hours yeah it's a long time in a plane you know I just read that part in the book orcas how we came to know and love the oceans greatest predator about the first killer the first cetacean to go on a plane was a killer whale flying to Europe for the captive industry really interesting from where thewhere from British Columbia or from Washington I don't know if they float out a candidate or US but it flew to I don't remember I think might have been Spain and it was a 6,000 pound whale it was the heaviest animal to ever fly in a plane really still not I'm sure they transported bigger killer whales since then yeah like Keiko was heavier than that when they flew him to Iceland hmm how much elephants weigh like 15,000 pounds the biggest ones are like African elephant I think 15,000 yeah the biggest how much is that killer away full-grown about 12,000 yeah oh really elephants taking the bigger than it we don't know what 15,000 for an elephant no that's way off no cuz they say I said they say that the blue whales clown weighs as much as the African elephant which is 15,000 pounds do we have any elephant ologist out there hey there's freaking elephants that swim in Thailand yeah man I want to get an underwater shot of theirs is there any wild ones left in Thailand do you think there are yeah I'd be pretty cool is that considered a Marine marine mammal then I'm giving Slater a funny look right at the ocean I call this one are they marine mammals - yeah they could be hey weirdos are pigs on fire festival okay we're right yeah yeah all the time okay how much is that full-grown African bull elephant way I'm not an elephant apologist but why you google that oh man it's in kilograms I can't do math okay well why your kilogram in it let's give a huge shout out to Robbie Mueller for one being a boss and always supporting our page oh yeah Thank You Robbie also supported us on patreon oh nice we have I guess we didn't even tell Eric log into the apps yeah Erika login I'm an old man I don't do social media you do you can describe that's about it but Thank You Robbie we really appreciate it yeah to patreon followers oh here we go backtracking again African bush elephant 3000 yeah it says this chart I'm like yeah it says up to the heaviest was fifteen thousand four hundred pounds Wow so I was right but this was like right at the same time that the killer will captive industry was starting to go worldwide this is also when elephants started to be acquired by zoos worldwide so yeah and water if you really think about they actually transport the water you get all the water stars what 8 to 9 pounds yeah so like it's okay real quick Oh we'll talk about this later is that entanglement report we can talk about it right now okay yeah we could talk about how awesome okay so no actually just a few days ago release there every year they released a report on the previous year about the entanglement with space it's the West Coast well entanglement summary so it looks like in 2018 we had 46 confirmed entanglements and a lot of people when we say 46 always go oh no you know that doesn't sound right it has to be more than that this is what is observed and confirmed don't forget there's a lot of things out of the ocean that happened that man never sees actually on the cover of this antennal report with the with the permit number on there but yeah you can actually find this it's probably already on the NOAA sites 2018 west coast well summer it's kind of depressing but it kind of gives you the data of what's been going on and it's obviously gonna you know help us better protect these whales but 46 confirmed entanglements and once again that's what's seen by humans there's you know a lot of things happen offshore that we never get to see but then you get further into it it actually lists the the species there was a few that are unidentified humpbacks blues and Gray's is what they have here and then they given a total number of humpbacks like let's just say humpbacks yeah so it goes it was 34 humpbacks 11 Gray's and one other which were probably the unidentified animals yeah but 46 confirmed total no oh yeah one blue in July but it's in parentheses so there's probably a and then they tried it their best to also identify the gear to this also helps us you know figure out what's going on out there and how we can maybe resolve these issues but California Dungeness crab commercial traps were seen on these animals Washington Dungeness crab traps or again and then a few other from states unknown they seem to be crab and spot spot spot prawn traps and even a few gill nets yeah the great whales had some trouble with the gill nets at the end of 2018 the thing with the gear is the Dungeness crab fishery in Oregon Washington California is one of the best identified gear types as far as the fisherman marked their gear the best so a lot of people like Oh Dungeness a is the worst but I mean in some ways yes it is one of the leading causes because they set the gear right where the whales tend to be but it's also one of the most easily identified types of gear too because the fisherman market really well so there is a little bit of bias there in the data and the and NOAA does a good job explaining that to Slater's photos are all over this thing is that your picture of scarlet - no that's Betty my remarks so 34 whales were entangled from facts humpback humpbacks yeah 46 total confirms there's almost two or more a month yeah they actually have breaking it down by months so it seems like when I humpbacks once it warms up August September well let's see not really but August September October November December had entanglements yeah April May okay so this is a neat chart you got crabs over during the winter to think about how many of those left and came back with crab pots or that was gear that was lost and then the whale ended up I mean they say that probably like five to ten percent of the gear gets lost every year and when you're looking at you know 300,000 crab pots off the Oregon coast that's a lot of pots that go missing you see how many do you have something like that yeah so they set hundreds of thousands of pots off the Oregon coast yeah I thought you said 300 I was like okay no no they keep in mind every one I know people like to you know demonize the the crab fishermen but you know keep in mind that a lot of these crab fishermen voluntarily go to meetings and stuff like that way no officials to do their best to try to you know make these issues minimum well in this year in California - I mean the Dungeness crab working group which is mostly crab fishermen did agree on a closure in mid-april when the the whales and the gear were overlapping too much NOAA actually converted the use of the whale alert app which was originally for shipping lane stuff they converted it to then report on where whales were in relation to fishing gear and there was just too much overlap being reported and places like Monterey Bay and so they closed the crab fishing early so little bit of progress there's so many whales here yeah a little bit of progress but yeah I mean we're still that's like Slater said it's more than it's like two whales a month so that is what's the latest on that row plus geared we hear rumors that it's getting cheaper then some people say that's not true it's still expensive does anyone know they're testing it on the East Coast I haven't really heard any reports yet yeah with the blue crab and lobsters yeah man the right whales are off to a rough start this season as well a lot of it ship strike but some of its entanglement - I've also seen whales I know like one I can vividly remember is a gray whale off Newport from the drone and it runs right into a lobster trap right there in front of that like right off the jetty you know and it hits it and then like once it hits it it like it's like I think it hit it like on his PEC fin or something and then it like kicked so hard and then I got caught on the tail for like just a second and then it came off cuz he didn't like twist into it you know but like it just shows you because I think when they feel something that's not like easy to me right help but yeah it can break in half that I think they it felt funny and then they just kicked really hard it scares them yeah so that's an another thing they're testing on the East Coast is the every I think 20 feet or so they have like a break point so when the whales do thrash like that they have these now these weak points in the line and it will break because the whales apply you know thousands of pounds of force when they thrash like that to get the gear off but the new ropes that fishermen use which last them longer are also a lot harder to break hmm do you think that remember that day that we meet you and Britt picked up like how many pounds yeah yeah yeah yeah steel do you think that they you know how they kelp you know what if they ever do that with rope if they see it's our Jamie I mean I picked up like a thousand feet of free-floating line one time out in the middle of the bay to there's even some top that some of these whales are approaching it on purpose great younger gray whales humpback whales younger whales well sometimes check it out you know there's even talk about that might be happening to one season we had crab stuff real late into the year like the crabbing was okay and so the fishermen were still fishing and killer whales like three or four different times are investigating the gear and like one time they yanked it I think with their mouth oh my gosh so stressful to watch it when I was watching that white killer whale uh-huh part of the pod was playing with a buoy we kept watching it go down and then they were preaching by it too so yeah I mean I think they're very smart yeah like I think for like ten minutes really one time wow he got it off but yeah he had one wrapped on his dorsal fin Wow i I saw white I think I had to drone up and they were pulling but I didn't get it they have stopped of course right when I got it up you know but they were pulling a buoy down right in front of a lobster buoy yeah I'm from the Newport yeah I'm pretty sure a lot of these interaction with them and they're these the toothed whales these traps and in stuff are on purpose I mean we see him play with kelp all the time like the other day we had that we know when I start playing like when it's it good see yes I'll get good kelp at ease here like ours that break off the islands yeah like ours are like big don't our not ours but like yeah but now our kelp it was really low the last two years Monterey we used to get huge killed I think you should break off here without rough the water yes well I think so that first winter you were here Slater we had those huge swells remember like 2030 yeah that's crazy that ripped all the kelp off and then the urchins really took a stronghold after that one yeah so we just haven't really had good kelp cover since then I think this year was pretty bad too I heard even the some ones that the abalone farm was even having trouble finding kelp to feed their animals yeah what you can do instead of just feeling like you're in despair is if you are in the US and you see an entangled whale there are phone numbers you can call or you can kill hail the coast guard on channel 16 you're on the west coast it's what is it 1 877 SOS whale something like that oh yeah 187 actually that works for all of the US 1 877 SOS well which is one eight seven seven seven six seven nine four to five and as you just said yeah channel 16 is usually universal here in the US for is the channel that US Coast Guard monitors yeah and then the other thing that is helpful for NOAA to file their reports is if you have your GPS location anything yeah pictures of the gear and the gear on the whale so if you have any trailing buoys and then photos of where it's wrapped on the whales body and then if you can stay with the whale until a vessel can come or leave you that's awesome if not my life yeah so what happens folks is the reason why they want you to document obviously location and all that other good stuff like photos and stuff like that that way the entanglement team knows what to expect and what equipment they should have with them and whatever you do even though we all love animals do not try to go in there yourself no please don't the whale gets really stressed and it's really big and strong it's not recommended to go and disentangle it yourself yeah definitely leave that up to the professionals yeah do for you guys I know a lot of us get that feeling like we should just go in there but yeah ours we're watching this whale because I'm in the drone up and he was like tied to the bottom in fact is that word is pictures from I don't know be honest he could have swam out like we gotta go through rocks and like so much stuff that might have been that angry photos picture man that okay so oh yeah that was really tough that we were without an hour there where was it like pebble beaches on the inside the 17 rather steel rock one of them yes yeah but no this is so in the photo on this catalog is the day that you and I were on all day trip with Kate we oh god has to stay with the well we went 20 miles on it and then we were out of our range and we had to turn back not because of like trip time but because if we can only go 20 miles from harbor and then we ended up turning around but this this whale right here it just had it lightly on the PEC fin and it was just like a line there was nothing trailing behind it so we think it was just a little piece of rope on deck feeling like it wasn't actually the whale may have been able to show ya like eventually if you look at look like you can see here yeah it's a bear it looks like it's barely on Lucille and almost it on like a barn yeah exactly looks like it's yeah barnacles almost yeah so but we ended up turning around after staying with that whale and we had like the best lunch feeling ever best learning into the sunset yeah that's reward for doing your good deed for the day harm us that's what we always say help out animals pick up trash and sometimes it seems like you get you receive a reward yes that picture I got was the first time I ever got on a cover of a magazine just going up I've had the ones that don't do it you know from the bathroom yeah the bathroom shot about them sorry guys no don't know what we're talking about go back to our special guest with Kate Cummings one do I talk about it on there yeah we yeah because we talked about the her boat and she's like oh yeah and can't you have the best bathroom shots yeah no we're out of that or out of that life yeah that works too my spirits yeah okay so yeah so this is going on I just we just mentioned entanglement teams to we're in fact we're just talking amongst ourselves maybe one day we can have someone here maybe talk about in detail the techniques and stuff it's kind of nice yeah and there's I only know the California teams and then Center for coastal studies kind of covers the northeastern seaboard I don't know how far up north they go I would think they go all the way up to Maine but they definitely covered Massachusetts like Stellwagen bank really well their response times really really fast and they have a lot of information on their website too because sometimes they're dealing with right whales so they have to really be on top of their stuff because I got super endangered whales that they respond to in Hawaii has I'd be curious to listen to theirs because I wonder how many are coming back from Alaska over to there with it usually they're disentangling a lot like 8,000 miles or something that there because it's 5,000 from here I think yeah yeah so then from up there it's got to be like 8 or 9 mm-hmm yeah they they definitely have reports of like Alaskan fishing gear on those whales and exactly yeah so maybe well we can do that guys we'll get someone from one of the the teams we know and bring up me here you you folks will be fascinated at the techniques and even kind of learn how difficult it really is I know like me and Slater always a freak out going I could just jump in with a knife but when you really look at the big picture you're really putting yourself in danger you know just like a scared when they you approach a dog when they know it's scared imagine an animal a lot bigger than that dog scared it's gonna do some damage yeah yeah yeah oh yeah that's why Peck thing could kill you exactly and people have people have unfortunately you know have passed away an accidents involving whale entanglement so not a laughing matter we all want to be heroes but it's it's it's scary at times well you have to do what's best for the animal to I mean they talk about you only get so many takes with a whale you only get so many tries before you've stressed it out so much that the whale does not cooperate anymore so if you screw it up on the first one royally by jumping in the water or something then yeah you may never save the whale yeah and I've heard from the Justin's about how especially right whales that flute can swing around literally touch their head yeah yeah that's what happened during the last there was one a team member that died it was a right whale doesn't hang me and the right whales flute came around yeah very flexible animals for how big their yeah we know humpbacks are flexible but yeah right wells you looked at me they look pudgy in slow but oh yeah you can move no wick wacky yep hey I came up with a cool use for a crab pot you have some decommissioned ones that were on the wharf and I turned them into flower pots you guys don't know Caitlyn is obsessed with succulents so you want to buy crab pot succulents oh nice but it came with like a hurt leaf but she's really sad about that part of it but there's no reefs nice nice so I guess it's been one whole week since the last one what did what did you see let's just start with Monday Monday it's been a lot mellower out here let's take a look when's the last time we met guys probably like the day before like Sunday I mean I saw you guys a day earlier well there's been kind of windy this last week or so as well yeah I guess it was like it turned out to be really fine yesterday oh really what's up with this claiming 25 knots and then like not I actually be a given yeah I was cashing in actually wasn't bad it was doable yeah I don't think that 25 knots that whenever ever appeared I don't know so basically I think every day we pretty much just had humpbacks Pacific white-sided dolphins northern right whale dolphins and Rizzo's some trips haven't had the other two dolphins that are northern right whale dolphins and the Pacific white-sided dolphins and then some have but it's been it's been pretty good did anyone see a blue ice in there Olympic blue wow so they hold their breath forever yeah yeah tell me about that yeah we they're like only two breaths and then they're gone yeah are you naughty that you breath one breath one breath in there and they're gone we've had a few blue whales do that to us but yeah blue whales white sizes humpbacks Rizzo's and last time we saw what our fifty ones was the twenty first for me Orca sightings everyone's always fascinated by the last time we all saw speaking of them holding their breath or taking one breath and then leaving someone competent on my Instagram and said do you think they like you watching them and like or do you think it bothers them that he watched em or something like that I said they could literally get away in one breath hold if they wanted to yeah I kind of I have a theory that there are whales that are less boat tolerant and we just never see them because they there's plenty of food in remote parts of the coast where there is a lot less boat traffic and so I think there are some whales that just choose to forage without an audience yeah we're in their home so like straight down and then out exactly I mean I think there is definitely like some some like caution and finesse that you need to have when you're driving around whales just to be more courteous but if they want to get away from you oh yeah they definitely can yeah I get that question a lot I don't want to say it's annoying but it's kind of does it make sense when people come on the boat well watching when I look at the whales and look at us no are we bothering the whales it's like we talked about this yeah we don't come out here purposely here's a good example father whales with the fifty ones on the 21st I think all of the so all the boats came and looked at him cuz it was calm and it was like one of the first good sightings of the morning and all of a sudden we all realized that there was like a lot of boats there and so boats started to leave which is really nice that the monterey fleet does that like you know the couple of the moss landing boats that had gotten there first we're like okay we're gonna peel off and then there was some Monterey boats that also are like okay we got our looks these whales are kind of just taking a nap we're gonna leave and so that was really nice that all of a sudden it was like a whole bunch of boats showed up and then everybody kind of like sorted themselves out and left the whales which was good because there's cases like that where yeah sure the 50 ones I've been had like you know eight or nine boats get ditched by him yeah no problem but it's also nice that they were courteous and really you know our people got to see the whales we'll go look at something else and that was a day and you know you mentioned that was a day that someone last brought that up to me and right they say that the whales are swimming right towards this yeah so yeah we're not none of us are out there to bother the whales we clearly love them we have a podcast about them so just trust us we love them it's our it's our livelihood we're not going to you know hurt harm or hurt what is you know luckily the best job in the world yeah interfere with that but a lot of whales also like are born in areas where there's whale watching in the breeding ground so they hear they understand what a boat is like from the day they're born yeah how much they've like become what is that worth acclimatized acclimated I don't know don't be using that word a bit more simple but you ated yes my snake isn't looking at you have a ball python like look at this plant yes my snakes looking looking at so it's been yeah humpbacks and dolphins there's not a lot of humpbacks like there's probably a lot in the whole entire Bay mm-hmm I mean I guess there's like five or six up back so there's still quite a bit of humpbacks and I told you that that fun fact that mar√≠lia figure it out right hmm they're humpbacks did show up you know on time and then some of the ones that were identified here too happy well went back down south towards there in California so please come back come backs I tell you guys this every year I don't know why you don't get it well I miss them June is the worst they come check in it's July I did you're wrong and mainly our last season I watch I'll even pull it up I'm looking at 2019 right now but they were here in double digits pretty much if there's a lunch feeding on my birthday I'm retiring early you can go be killer whales on my birthday there was there was killer rolls on my birthday and then I left to Iceland the next day do you guys remember that was that last year the year before two years ago now but isn't that cool so maybe July 3rd fat fins gonna be here I can sense it you guys are looking to see killer whales come on July 3rd is that a guarantee yes this episode will be out by then I'm just kidding I'm not even gonna fight either on my birthday I'm like yep I don't know doing something I know what I'm gonna do probably do anything I'm for sure probably gonna be there because of weather suppose to be good all week oh is it I don't know my birthday's on a Wednesday you know what I did see though was two fully grown already looking very wide humpback whales on Thursday like big big adults which was pretty cool some of the biggest humpbacks I've seen all season so far they're definitely like 50 plus feet and when they came up you were like wow these are some huge whales you know what's so funny is I felt like back in March like when we had all those humpbacks that were in the blue water and it was crazy I was like they came early and I was like I remember like talking out on Instagram like daily like all my posts were like all so glad to see them back they're just like not here and I feel like it died off bye yeah little tiny mid Octus you're looking at 2018 records and it seems like more consistent days that we're getting humpbacks into the double digits and these last few days are repeatedly outputting you guys are so spoiler here it's been later Caitlin no spoil don't listen okay I'm looking at my Caitlin there's no science says the two that have not lived here as long as I have check my degree not even that it's just anecdotal from spending time out on the water whatever it's okay they'll be back it'll be okay you promise you know yes I promise meeting and promising the whales will come back wait I want to know something do you think they must feed every single summer in Monterey since the beginning of time no why not I don't know you think there's a year that's gone by without zero lunch beads in the bay I don't know exactly every year that's kind of cool thing about crazy talk like one what if it was just like one little chomp and that's it that counts yeah that's a surface eating their side lunges vertical oh you know what you guys I swear I've only seen the humpbacks actually feed on like I know they could be feeding on krill but I've only seen them at the surface if you don't grill like one time and at one time I got that cool say you haven't your own video my favorite videos we haven't really had a big curl year since I moved here honestly that happened this year I mean maybe I just seen a lot of krill and I haven't seen any egg yolk jelly since before I moved here yeah you know what's funny is I've been talking to that with a few people yeah the jellies just are not here yet hopefully they do show up but I have to go Bay is supposed to getting a good yeah good amount of choice right now a little bit north of us what kind of jellies moons at least I heard a thing up in that area too because the people that fly the turtle survey said they saw a lots of prey but no turtles they fly a turtle survey no they fly a plane to look for so speaking of flying things to look for things they've been seeing lots of great white yeah great white sir once again all these little youngsters are close to our shoreline here in the bag little youngsters are like 12 feet some of them are I guess somewhere 14 they're saying really so I rented a little ones are still that of the usual quits what are you doing to your 12-foot great white Caitlin look at it look at she don't even look at my snake but she'll look at a great white why are you afraid this little cutie I'm not afraid don't worry you can come back out here Kaitlyn it's not that no stay in there stay in your hide well well have you guys heard any whale news um sad well news sad well new stars there's just six dead right whales most Lords yeah have we talked about that Luminara Oh then or whatever who did that um nature did yeah so what's the what's the backstory on the skull a skull google it it's been around for a while but then also and someone's like look closer looking and maybe even did DNA going hey yeah so this this is the luga Narwhal hybrid exists between those two because the skull size and shape and the teeth and the teeth like the bottom jaw on the front they're all twisted like a narwhal tusk which is actually technically teeth and then the fact that it has that many teeth indicates that must be a beluga hybrid yeah you know new guys that's what they're doing oh I saw that picture actually the teeth looked funkadilly yeah so what happens it gets the full story is in the 80s Inuit hunter actually killed one and he realized it was really strange looking so that's what happened in the 1980s or the eighteen nineteen eighties yeah okay anyway so they're still allowed to I thought there was record of this goal being like wailed oh look at the article right now that's telling me in the 1980s oh they found a skull yeah I think I saw it what in the wild no no this is Thomas Cole he actually killed these animals oh this is we have a photo of it there of it alive they just have this goal yeah we should get the people that live there camera take pictures of their caches probably they're just like whatever dude wanted this thing yeah this is the verify through yeah DNA oh cool so they were able to drill some some I learned I learned a cool word what in situ in situ I'm saying he's been saying it a lot the last few days really I haven't heard him say it I've been just telling Eric about it so it's when you see if you take a picture of an animal in situ its before their behavior has been altered by your presence I think right science they're mostly Google it in the moment in in the environment in its natural environment yeah yeah but as before you like yeah but once you've changed it if you've changed the behavior if you've like lifted the rock and moved it out if it's a snake or something yes whatever a new little pocket dictionary or just science words science dictionary oh by the way Siri tells you jokes yes where does a where does it boat go when it's sick [Laughter] there's hopefully I'm hopefully going to the one in Barcelona in December which is a world marine mammal conference so the Society for me mammalogy and the European cetacean Society are combining their conference together in Barcelona and December and I find out on Friday if the poster abstract we submitted it got accepted or not so you're only go for that um yeah I mean I really love Barcelona but it's pretty far away and it's pretty expensive so we'll see yeah but then the next ACS conference is next year he's gonna be Monterey we'll see there's a lot of people that want it to be in Monterey but no one's decided officially yet Oh turn it was Newport the other day right back come on right right I mean where does it go take it wherever we want it's like not my house it's not big enough you just sound we're going San Juan Island yeah well people meet on Island potentially I mean I have a boat that you guys could possibly go on if you do it September 21st or 22nd this year I'm talking next year well there's seven spots left my San Juan Island trip if you guys are interested in looking for transient orcas resident orcas humpbacks and tons of marine life Eric's not invited could it be in the Atlantic nice land you're gonna be nice and wait you're taking cruise there yeah dude look out for icebergs for real dude icebergs float from Greenland all the way into Iceland yeah well there's not too many icebergs left did we talk about this it's a marine mammal the poles oh yeah did we talk about it you and I talked about it I don't think we talked about on the pike so when I was in Iceland the guy the owner of the whale watch company actually yeah let's just say he was the owner he told was telling us a story of how a polar bear from Greenland was on an iceberg and it drifted all the way across from greenland - iceland and then obviously it melts on it along its way and then it swims the rest of the way dude that's one hungry polar bear by the time he gets so it's a really sad story because the polar bear will basically anything including people once it gets to land that they have to like put it to sleep so it was a really sad story but it's also really crazy that a polar bear can just like drift across the ocean I mean if your rides going across the ocean dude you're gonna are they in the water swimming you're not freezing cuz they have special like fat and hair for that yeah but come on they're not sea otters no they have fat that's all their novice the otter you think that I can't they're like their blubber layers thick and that's like it's almost like well thicker now no I don't think it's well thick not thick like but that very often think I don't know what do you think Eric but they are considered marine mammals right gosh if you look in some field guides about right now some people put them in there some people don't what do you consider them I technically considered a marine mammal yes so I would see their environments very marine I guess some of them do go pretty far inland though for food so that a bunch of polar bear pictures with them taking through trash has just been brought up recently on it I saw it on Sonja it's really sad well what are we gonna do pick up your trash I think they were in a landfill guys want to hear my million-dollar idea what okay I'm teaming up with 7-eleven we just got metal straws that are Slurpee straws and when you buy slippy in the straw you get a free one the next time a Slurpee are you serious are you just making things of course I'm making that up a 7-eleven wouldn't that be cool about someone okay if someone can design a Slurpee straws oh like sell that to 7-eleven dude it would be like a knife point it did it oh yeah we got surpise there I guess you can make it more of a kind like a spoon at this yeah yeah they can actually use that the metal book I kind of do I could Eric just admitted to use it on kid he got oh can you edit that part out yeah I like Slurpee I always feel bad with the boba straws but luckily there's metal Bobo straws now that's what I'm doing on my birthday well no it's a free Slurpee so 7:11 birthday 73 birthday can you get a free slurpie on her birthday oh that's like cakes that like benning's or something I've never tried that hey guys hey well Oh Barrett the Latin name translates the maritime bear Wow hmm Erick hitting us with the facts all right guys we're totally off nom Marine Mammal know we're evil Jason know what this draw and well it's all going well Plastics going with the ocean right now so yep yeah fortunately oh no I'm not to talk about it she's not don't worry we talked about so much that stuff already we're all adults here okay well that sea lion I've been around with the salmon flasher in his mouth yeah there's so many - and the flasher is like a it's like a big lure but doesn't have a hook on it it's like it creates a flash to kind of lure the fish into the area and then it yes but it's tied like with a long leader and then if it's in the mouth and the hooks like way down in the sea lion yeah anyways they've been trying to catch I don't know if it's the same sea lion or if there's multiple but I Eric had a video yeah every kind of video of them trying to catch it in Moss Landing and I actually called the Marine Mammal Center not yesterday two days ago and sent them photos that I took of it and I guess they went out there and tried again but where it was I could easily just jump off into the water yeah the problem is if it's by a bunch of other sea lions they won't go for it because they'll flush all the other scenes hey the picture it was underneath the wharf - you got a video of it Eric was at Moss Landing like where was it just on a dock there's on the dock no solution this one was out of the wharf - you know in the big pillars such a bummer yeah I mean you gotta think about big that Faja is that's a big seal and yeah so that's another resource if you see pinniped industry in distress call the Marine Mammal Center if you're in California there's different regions - yeah nowadays then help you out I called the one in Moss Landing but there's one further north I think Sausalito yeah okay yeah and then down south there's the Pacific Marine Mammal Center right yeah but there's a few between that yeah thanks guys a question and there's - now - probably okay so how do you feel about them taking sea lions I have been bitten by sharks mmm I don't know if they do actually I'm just wondering I feel like I'm I cuz people always like if you show a picture of that people like oh my god did you save it yeah so there's a few were like I've seen this like bones exposed like the spine and stuff it's been hit late by the back flippers and I'm like okay Marine Mammal Center should probably pick that one up but there was one that was like bit right in the abdomen that they didn't pick up and we watched it heal all summer and it was fine I mean it's gross until it's healed but it healed and it's fine yeah there was one out there coat like a week ago a couple weeks ago it's on the rock wall there's no one yeah get it but it was crazy shark bite you can see all the different like layers of - yeah tear yeah yeah honestly sometimes the stress of catching the sea lion driving it up to the facility giving antibiotics is what kills it instead of the bite itself yeah so sometimes a guy look at it and I'm like I think it would be okay but if I see like guts hanging out or like exposed bones I'm like okay you should probably call how do you guys feel about well so okay so obviously a shark is a natural animal that eats sea lions that's what I'm thinking yeah sure - so I'm like you're taking away and it was sadly meant to die you just took like a crab food away whatever else food away yeah yeah but then like if you see something humans yeah yeah okay I don't saying like when it's like this a fishing lure or a crab pot yeah you know and we obviously as humans did that then I think it's definitely a good reason to call yeah yeah I think you shouldn't call if you see something hurt you may not know what it's caused from yeah average person might not know it yeah it's really interesting or something you know that like you should just call the Marine Mammal Center or a center the Quincy El Nino incidents happened you know my cell all the Senators helping out and like a lot of us at the aquarium who any husband Terry Donald's were called to to go there and then some people saying you know why are you using so many resources on a natural yeah yeah think that's true - you can't have to look at the population - but I mean I don't know that's a hard one like because how many different breeding mercury's that don't exist anymore that could like repopulate eventually are they all one stock or they not like it's kind of a hard decision and sea lions are technically considered overpopulated right or no depending on the area there's still a lot of it especially nowadays with are they to say I mean it's so funny that they say that there when there's like tons more here yeah I think this fishermen just don't like it down there people like me I grew up hearing like you know we always we were always taught there's too many of them and they steal our finish well they always say like him this one of the speeches down there it's like they double in population every seven to ten years how do you love that that I made up facts I feel like that's a made up fact but these animals that they mean it's it's sea lions unfortunately they have always gotten a bad rap but I always tell people about the 20s when commercial fishing yeah tell us later here's me talk about this all time in the 20s when commercial fishing really took a boom here people were just slaughtering them they think there were only two thousand left and did you guys hear that there was a sea lion pup born in Monterey Harbor yeah saw the photos actually yeah yeah at the breakwater and I think the mom and pop are still there because someone posted a video of the mom and pup like doing a swimming lesson and there actually is a mercury is very small rookery on ano nuevo island and same Santa Cruz so they do breed up here too a little bit most of our sea lions do migrate south but there is a little breeding corner they breed on the fair lawns they I think they do probably write a small I think there's a small group there but I'm not sure they're actually breathing in it that's a good question I think we probably have a few listeners I know we have a two or three listeners from Sur what's this go they might go well I think that about wraps this one up huh I think so yes we need some cool sightings to happen be patient the whales will come back have some faith you guys the whales will come back I believe it okay good I just need some photos I just want to be able to count back into double digits of humpbacks every day turn my camera off and not like have to be watching for every moment I want to like just enjoy them when there's so much cool I want so many whales around I don't have to choose all my shots wisely yeah we like so spoiled here we're talking about I want double digits there's people like I just want to see something with a blowhole annotation will do a couple people today on the boat from Germany they came all the way here to see that's right and it was their first time seeing humpback cool yeah and it was a good show today huh yeah they actually weren't bad they popped up really close to the boat when they were so far away like they went so far away from us and then like we're just like cruising along and then on the opposite side of us they popped up like yeah swing up wonderful fun dress yeah we weren't going anywhere just I'm popping up next to us isn't he that was cool nice all right you guys will thank you for listening to this podcast make sure you follow us on instagram at Whale nerds yes please and what else think about joining us on patreon if you can yeah and also guys send in

hello everyone and welcome back to the well Nerds podcast this is episode number 28 my name is Slater and I'm here with Eric and Kaitlin hey everyone hello and Laci my dog is here today because he's walking all over us Laci really wants to be in the podcast instead of napping this time alright so guys I didn't go whale watching today what what did you see well listeners and one of our listeners yeah what yeah I came to visit all the way from back that's Canada of course I wasn't there and they're gonna come back tomorrow which is cool you get to meet him of course I'll be there you actually listened to us he said we took your tip and instead of just doing just one day I became multiple days to increase our chances of seeing cool stuff good idea I recommend yes as many days as you can tomorrow's gonna be a good day too because I'm leaving out of town the next day so it means it's my last day on the water and what means we're always gonna see something great before I leave that tells me this keep staying today it wasn't too bad we had a good variety out there would you see we had humpbacks Rizzo's Pacific white-sided dolphins northern right whale dolphins and harbour porpoise he molas so it's a good day out there no riot he out there where your mole is alive today I'm all those were alive today I didn't tell people about dead mullahs I saw a few dead ones yesterday there were some in the harbor date they were literally right under the boat and also well see we get to show him else was neat today um well northern right whale dolphins were showing really well today I always tell them how difficult they are to spot but porpoising following the boat today so very easy to show people those usually more difficult species out there you know what I did today you ate a burrito I know that I went to the laundromat and it hurt to just do one blanket it costs it we just wanted this huge blanket so we need like a really big one you know huh it costed it well first off the machine all the machines there guess what the price was how much about four dollars nine dollars why $9 don't have to Monterey you guys know normal all the normal ones around here and are three dollars or whatever this one was nine well cuz it was like a super washer wasn't nothing it was just a regular washer where was this with a cranky lady in the back what's the one on my Safeway or Trader Joe's was it it was by Whole Foods okay what the hell yes that's why I know which one to avoid then yeah I'm never going there thanks so weird anyways nine dollars for one blanket to be washed so that was cool well guess what I did today what I tabled on the war for international Vicky today what's a vaquita a burrito oh it's a little cow no that veal it sure it's a it's the world's smallest cetacean it's also the world's most endangered cetacean we were talking with they we were telling people there's 15 left but I think it's really single digits I heard Bob Pitman say that last year uh-huh yeah that's why I'm here increased across ages currently but so that means less than ten yeah but Leonardo DiCaprio produced a movie in addition with Nat Geo it premieres on Friday I'll see if shadows and it's about the cartels and the black market trade and the porpoise you see you're gonna be in it it's an eco thriller no I don't think he's in it is it yeah it's a documentary but it's like in the Eco thriller category at one at Sundance no I don't think so I think he's just strictly behind the scenes but it premieres in LA and New York on Friday and then it plays in select theaters starting Saturday and then it's supposed to play in San Francisco on the 15th and then we're actually gonna try and get a screening at the Osio theater in Monterey at the end of the month oh cool yeah if they approached us they approached a CS and they wanted our help promoting the film and arranging screenings and stuff so if you actually if our listeners want a screening in their town and they think they could sell at least 30 tickets at their local theater and the theater will host the ticket sales and everything you just have to promote it and try and get 32 tickets sold they'll set it up they'll set up the screening yeah I know Long Beach is gonna do one orange cones are gonna do one Newports gonna do one I mean I could uh promote it yeah yeah we're once we get a date from the Osio theater well we'll put it out for everybody so we can go see it oh there are does anyone up here yeah they said they would reach out to the Osio on our behalf and then once we have a date they want our help promoting you know on behalf of a American cetacean Society monitoring Noli will be at the LA premiere on Friday so yeah somebody's gonna get to be there and talk to him super cool that's awesome that we have some big a-list celebrities actually trying to push conservation out there and he does a lot of work for conservation too yeah he does he did what was that last film he did about climate change stuff I for you it is called oh yeah he did do one and he invested might be on burgers and a bunch of other things yeah be a lot of vegan stuff so that's pretty cool excuse me as the pressing as it is I think it's still important to like teach people what a vaquita is because even if it's too late we still have some lessons to learn about how to save the next endangered species or endangered population like the southern resident killer whale or the North Atlantic right well you know like the Bhaiji went extinct in 2006 and no one even knew what it was I what it say Yangtze River Dolphin by G bagel no it's a dolphin dude we've talked about that dolphin before yeah we have earlier I guess I'm er yeah because we talked about it this Ocala marine mammal workshop yeah so I think it's still important that people know what if Akita is even if it's too late to save it because we've got to learn some lessons otherwise we're not gonna be able to knit around for other animals yeah and the vaquita is such a I mean there's so many factors it's not just biological you know with the vaquita it's political I mean we're talking about actual literally the cartel being involved it's oh yeah difficult you know situation yeah you got a easily corrupted government you got big cartels and big money and on it you've got Dane more than one endangered species the fish that they're catching that is by catch the big Iquitos bycatch in that's also illegal to catch that fish it's not just a bycatch issue it's their targeting and endangered species to you so it's really complicated and high-stakes issue and I'm hoping they do sounds like they did a really good job I mean you don't win Sundance for nothing so I'm excited to see the film yeah me too I'm excited actually when do you guys think it might be here probably at the end of July it should be a Monterey that's awesome hopefully yeah hopefully it's pretty widespread because a lot of these smaller documentaries are pretty amazing and it's just so limited you know who has access to it like that scars about the reserves dolphins that was amazing I wish you know everyone had access to it hopefully it'll be available soon yeah I would guess that probably after it does its whole film promotion and premieres and stuff that see if shadows does end up on it like Nat Geo channel or something because they're one of the producers of it yeah I hope said to you you guys yes I feel like I haven't been watching him forever since yesterday yeah dude okay my birthday yes no you weren't the day before yeah it's my birthday month guys it's my birth month I can't I can't wait so funny cuz there's some of our listeners are landlocked and probably go well watching you know maybe been once or twice and you're like man yesterday so mean whatever it's been a rough month for Slater more it's been rough weather month yeah a rougher Monterey yeah yeah that's part of why you know everything goes there's a little bit of wind in the forecast say Tamar's not there it's a fair-weather whale watch her get seasick no but I get sick of the sea just kidding so yesterday afternoon was the middle trip was the best trip of the day so weird usually usually the mornings pretty good yeah exactly and then sometimes afternoon and evening can hold the standard and sometimes it's like that's better yesterday afternoon we leave the harbor and there's for coastal volcanoes right there oh I saw the story at first yeah and then obviously then we get outside the bay and we see a mixed group of Rizzo's Pacific white-sided dolphins and Rizzo's dolphin so we're up to sport for species dollar sorry last for an hour then we had humpback whales and all of a sudden next to us a blue whale popped up oh cool and the accidental look we got at the blue whale for one surfacing was better than I think everyone else that tried to actually look at yeah I think we've been seen the same blue out here for numerous days there's is one blue we literally see pop up once and then it like disappears and people are yeah one boat waited for it and said it was like 14 and a half minutes or something on the dive and it only to took two breaths and then went down again that's when we saw today two breaths yep I don't even know like I remember you took a breath you just back yeah and just disappeared yeah there's been this one particularly well I literally saw a back and then it just disappeared and we're just I was like thinking like oh man it's only as crew members who saw it I think actually the day we had it two people in the bass I okay and the evening trip was like oh it was a struggle bus there for a little bit like we it would got choppier on the five o'clock then we thought it was gonna get we thought was gonna kind of hold like the 1:30 but it was still doable and we were making our way out there was just slow and I was like dude I was telling the captain I was like we've got to be close to where we had these whales last like we've got to be seeing them by now cuz if the horizon was backlit and we were seeing nothing finally I was like I think I see some Rizzo's and then he's like okay keep your eye on him and I did for like five minutes I didn't see him again and I was like no I made it up right tricked me then I saw him so then we got the Rizzo's and then that gave us an opportunity to slow down and we finally saw a freaking whale oh my god I thought we were gonna have to give rain checks cuz we couldn't find them and then we found like six okay good those dramatic so our our second trip ended up being pretty spectacular to or morning trip was good second our second trip it was less whales but but they they did everything with his cow-calf pair humpback the mom was eating and the calf was just like last your penis later notices sometimes the cap just don't want to eat and they just go out and go play so it has it was breaching chin slapping oh that's that's cool got close approaches and people got to see how big a calf really is you know they think like oh this little five-foot whales gonna swim up to him but no it'll 25-foot closed approach yeah we took a video of them yeah but that's the furthest north linn the bay wait we've been recently yeah we're off of the Rio Del Mar area there was literally a school of anchovies about a half-mile long out there but only three whales were there were like oh come on I know I feel like that's how all last week was there's like football fields of anchovies at the surface and no whales yeah did the calf have white back vis um you know I took a pic did you look at my post I put a picture of it I don't look hurry I don't follow you I know you never liked do you feel like more okay not the way I saw I do feel like more whales or coming back into the bay it's just it's been pretty choppy so it's kind of hard to get him get between the sightings yes come on back inside is waiting for you yeah if you lunch feeds off and on yesterday in the afternoon in the evening nothing that was easy enough to like get a photo of but we did get to see a few lunges speaking I'm coming back into an area guess what came back into the Salish Sea I heard a rumor you did I did about to tell you okay tell me the southern resident killer with us yeah I heard it might even be all three pods yeah I mean I heard all three pods but then I thought I heard only like l87 at 187 which is obviously which is always with J pod anyways I think no I've heard some other ones there on the hydrophone today actually I saw someone post it yeah I've been here the last couple days I think sweet yeah there's four different spots where they can hear I saw someone make a post about it which is really yeah well if we figure out where that is on the interwebs maybe we'll post that for you guys so you can listen to it - oh you guys someone texted me a picture today and he he said that is this someone our superfan yes he said that at Mercer best photo he'll ever get in his entire life what was it and he said I said well if you don't send it to me then I don't care and he said you have to wait till tonight and then I said oh I don't care Adam we're VIPs Wow Wow and the whales name is Mike he thinks I don't know what number well that is but I said Mike shoot what part is EJ I don't know I don't know I feel like if I heard that I've heard of that whale before though but yeah that's funny because he didn't want to he that hasn't posted yeah we got the VIP look thanks Adam yeah Adam on trade shot did Adam always gets a super ultra rare things yeah he does I can't wait though because I'm gonna be up there next week yeah dude you're leaving me all of your zoo of animals in tomorrow monday Monday I don't even remember what days are are you taking your doing the seaplane thing this time seaplane so we fly into Seattle and then we take a little bus over to another like I think like a lake or something they fly off of some sort of like some body of water some water where they take the seaplane off and yeah we're gonna to fly over the islands and right into Friday Harbor what's this it's the sound the assume he makes again just just so but that's mainly when they're landing good takeoff sound and then but then I'm gonna be like excuse me pilot I know where there's a killer well Zach because my friends are gonna happen text me and he's gonna do a flyby you can't be using your phone in the plane that's illegal that's what the planes are allowed I swear someone told me that the planes are allowed to do one circle like not low but like still like a thousand feet or whatever that oh yeah but they're allowed to do like one circle and they keep going there's not like that something like that I think but I hope they do so you're gonna be like sliding them a hundred and be like here dude please circle these whales one time I mean I will take a picture of you driving the plane with the whale the background I have two politic you take the scenic route that's kind of cool they know the day that was regulated - oh I'm sure 100% they can probably only go like to their landing areas and that's it well yeah that's probably you have to register your flight path with that yeah I think about man if that was like allowed imagine how many private planes and helicopters would be out there do this start a helicopter well watching company in San Juan Islands I know think about how high your of I mean you can't be serving them right oh think is a helicopter is loud like a drone is not loud you literally have to crash the drone into the water and it still might not even make noise when the drunk crashes and the water and no one's there that listen to it does it make a sound [Laughter] you know there was a company that did helicopter whale watching tours when those blue whales were here a couple years ago oh yeah specialized yeah yeah wait that was fun yeah a bunch of people were trying to see the blue whales from there I went like four days too late we saw a fin whale and a humpback whale and some sunfish yeah you went up there and there yeah it looks okay guys helicopters are scary cuz like there's no escape route like a plane can still land if they're like engine goes down they can still like pull up you know and like guide its way in somewhere but a helicopters just you're done like I'm just saying I lived you can do it with the doors off too you can do doors I think I'm not gonna do it I do for sure do it a million times but like it just yeah you need to try it one day was it the Blues coming good baby we gotta go I'm surprised you haven't done it yet but what's funny is they tell you to take off your lens hood but it actually that's part of my thing if it's really windy make sure you take your lint it off because all those part of your pro tips yeah bro laters pro tips take mercy on the oceans windy it blows right into your lens hood and starts to pull it in the direction I push it into that direction so on top of the boat moving the wind and the whales I'm like when you're shooting photos on a tripod take your camera strap off yeah is it around that's true Pro tips by Caitlin and Slater listen we're just trying to get you some nice photos okay Eric takes his lens cap off he would do a little better you know what camera on lens cap back captain Danny I actually lifted my camera today wasn't even on I was like why is it focusing okay Tara not why is always off luckily I was just trying to get ID photos friends friends oh yeah even though it's Fran it's just like taking pictures she's a sleepy sleepy will that's so funny cuz that's what she was doing oh yeah we saw her Thursday with a with a friend that had like a cut on his back is that limb his limb have a recent scar and his dorsal fin it's why does the lamb have a limb I mean what Oh his name is Lim Lim L AM L a and B no but maybe it's bird I don't know um but she was hanging out dude she was so boat friendly but she was napping the whole time she gave lots of boats really good looks at her yeah they were close to the boat today and looked every now and then but yeah it was sleepy time today it's kinda weird yeah well you know what before she fluked up I was like I wonder if this is Fran cuz she's taking such a close nap to the boat and then she fluked and I was like ah alright there's some whales with some really cool flukes on the outside of the bay too yesterday really interesting patterns whales I didn't recognize ya oh you didn't recognize no I don't know who they were but they were really neat to take photos though yeah I did get a pet I don't even looked at my mercury you guys I definitely got a breach like last week and I got a couple pics laughs yesterday were you oh yeah we did have some pics ops yesterday yeah there was two of them right yeah was back when we were with the dolphins well there's dolphins everywhere I think we saw dolphins the whole trip pretty much all those white tides in northern right whale dolphins we actually had a really good Rizzo and Pacific Whiteside social encounter happened next to the boat for like ten minutes like really tight circling all rolling around together and then something happened they all just start splashing and scattered I think that was when our boats yeah we're all in the same area I noticed that too yeah they were like having a great time right next to our boat and then I think someone you know pissed someone else off in the pot and they are like see you wouldn't wanna be ya yeah it's been really good even though the weather's been a little up and down it's still actually really been good I'm glad to see the upwelling wind because it was a little late this season and I was getting worried but I'm glad to see it because of this one turn in some stuff up it's all coming from the north right northwest one more thing I noticed this year is we don't have any a good amount of jellies yet not yet did we last year this time almost went like mid-july they saw him in Half Moon Bay when they flew that turtle survey a couple weeks ago mmm you know what I'm gonna do this Yorick what I'm gonna have someone holding me about my feet and stick my phone in the water for the yeah we learned our well you got make sure your food has the o-ring in it I was leaning over the I was leaning off they're like bow off the dog we grab your legs yeah and then everybody was handing me the phone to take pictures of it and I took I don't think I really use yours you did your own but man I know I did Amber's I did someone else's and everybody's phone broke yeah mine I still use it to this day but the home button doesn't work on it I don't you like three phones and what didn't you say the Apple one of your phones is sitting on the bottom of the ocean it you know the week I moved in Newport I lost one and then like I don't know a couple my couple months ago I lost my remember yeah didn't the Apple guy say you just got this rare defect like they forgot the o-ring yeah that first one was there were the one I dunked in the water it was missing and ring where the SIM card slot is SIM cards which is not my fault because technically they are water-resistant my into that survived yeah so impossible it was the same I mean if you guys wanna check your phones in for jellyfish feel free don't blame us if you break your phone because we're all telling you we broke our I've seen other people do it and their phones are fine I got some really cool pictures when I did it yeah or you could just buy like a GoPro yeah or a DJI Osmo and buy the housing maybe even some of those letter backs come can I please see a leatherback sea turtle this summer or what yeah you get up to yesterday - really yesterday afternoon yesterday afternoon a fisherman actually reported I'm over by SoCal a letter back nope no whale watching boats got onto it but I think sea spirit and a blue ocean got heard heard it over the radio dude okay let me know I need to see one um you guys know what I want to see while I'm in the same one islands southern residents nope boy yes foxes yeah actually bald eagles okay but it's a marine mammal stellar sea lions actually is a marine mammal river otter yeah it's not a marine mammal it's an aquatic mammal what science in the name of weasels what is it it's an aquatic mammal but it's not marine it's mostly okay so let me ask you guys a question if a river otter lives nowhere near a river who lives only on an island in the middle of all saltwater is it still a river otter Iowan river otter I mean there's technically rivers that run into the end of that area Creek otter yeah there's fresh water on the island it's a freakin saltwater otter hey that rhymes I see them there I'm gonna see one this week I got a five fold it well no I get there Monday and I'm going on well watching 5:30 you guys one here man trips I'm going on like Ted no I'm going Monday night 5:30 then I'm going to z'd a in the morning and then skipping lunch and then going Tuesday in the evening and they're basically the same thing for Tuesday Wednesday Thursday I'm doing morning and then evening trips so I'm skill seven chips you're scooping what I'm doing maybe I'm doing one in the last day I'm not sure we'll see I get it I get a visit like the well Museum again are you just gonna stand the boat yeah cuz well cuz Margo's first time so I'm probably gonna go to like the well resume the Center for well research yeah there's lots there's so much stuff on the island yeah there's it's so cool out Whaley it is it's fine me and Lacey on Netflix and chill it's really cool Caitlin's holding down the fort at my place she's gotta watch my bearded dragon do yoga she does do yoga and then yeah visiting hours for Lacey at the shop will be Thursday and Friday from 8 to 2 so if you'd like to go see her there discomfort will watch that she'll be yes if you want to meet Slater Moore's dog no one that takes a nap every time we podcast except for today she was just screwed scratcher she was all over the place today you guys dude I feel like you're gonna see some good stuff up there oh yeah how's me see you guys there's also a sperm whale that's been seen there before and Jeff and Sarah and all of them got to see it and they got a picture of it with Jeff got like this amazing picture with a lighthouse huh what do I see sperm well just recently it was cool this was I think last summer last year ok last year but yeah isn't that cool experimental came in there like a month I feel like it's appalling the Monterey pine trees it does me too think you're allergic to your bearded dragon Eric let me ask you a question are you watching tomorrow I am well watching almost every day forever so I'm with you tomorrow yeah Kalyn you I'm on Wednesday Thursday and Friday and then Sunday dude she's been well watching a lot lately act like I don't even know you guys honestly she might not be in the podcast any work she's just whale watching tonight i okay confession if I don't see a whale I get kind of cranky I think I've said this before in the podcast but sometimes I'll be honest me coming off yeah they know they know like oh man I'm like dude we saw this she's like shut up she's so mad I know it too what I still tell her cuz it's awesome yeah like I'll tell our captains in like if you don't take me to see a whale soon I'm gonna do something drastic in this office that's my usual like I need to see a whale scary face yeah it's been good it's been good it's been a it's been bouncy but we've had lots of lots of good visitors and good whale action lots of dolphins so very dolphin yeah it's a company dry yeah a year actually since April has been just dolphin City yeah dolphin dolphin so I'm okay with that I love northern right whale dolphin so getting to see him am i yes it's bumming me out because they were such a rarity and now it's like I you know I told you talk about a million times we sell people we see in like a few times a year now it's been like every single week I have zero issue with it no I don't the other day they remember we pulled up to him it was bumpy yeah someone was getting seasick on the bow and they were showing so well but no one could get to the baddest cuz the lady had like taking a piss Drago's of whale watching yeah and then and then like a water came over and splash someone in the face it was it was it was rough but it was like it was still doable and it wasn't like unsafe or anything it just a couple happened to be like all in the moment plus the dolphins were going so fast that we had to keep up with yeah we but they were they were showing really well like in unison northern right whale dolphins were so that was really cool yeah it was a good because they're mixed in with three 200 species it's like wow it's like one stop and we're done yeah that was for speech that was a day with northern right whale dolphin specifically right sorry dolphins Rizzo's and the humpbacks we have like three hot dogs here how this - oh cool yeah and sea otters when I was doing my blog last time I was finishing I was like we saw this is this net and he was like what about the goals and the otters and the sea light I was like oh my gosh the baby goals are getting so tall oh by the way guys there were three goals right I thought there was only two the whole time it's today it's been 2 for like a week yeah no there was not three yesterday I'm pretty sure there was last day I left there were three because remember they walked all the way down to the three I was a nice shot but today there was two oh I was only immunity so you guys feelin what do you guys think in walked off the wall or a peregrine oh peregrine falcon both are I'm 50/50 on that because those things are walking next to the lead Jude if the last year one fell down members a bird I would not put my nest next to water even if I was an aquatic birds in here go are they aquatic words exactly Marine marine bird bird see brothers see their sea bird their bird eyeballs Pete okay but anyways those little sea chickens are right next to the wall and I could no matter what it's like an eight-foot drop yeah probably I kidding concrete for that little thing do you guys not remember last year when one fell down it was standing on the tires I wasn't there can't go down there and fly pick it up I think it's too heavy I don't think she can pick it up if you can pick up a bread bowl can probably pick up a baby yeah the bread wall doesn't move and drop the label oh jeez but they dropped the bread bowl regularly I used to throw them in the salt water and then they were picking up a salt one of the things water you guys don't know over in Monterey Fisherman's Wharf a chowder filled bread bowl is like a staple and for some reason the uneaten bread bolts into F in the water become food yeah okay we're at two western goals up I'm not that sad about it wow I mean I thought they were - the whole time so I didn't even know I was missing one so when we get rid of Kaitlyn on the podcast for all animals Kaitlyn even the goals is that true yeah I started a Western goal fan club I feel like you're lying in fact tomorrow I'm starting my first podcast called nerds you know it he said about the Western goal versus a human gold out of the day crack me up he's like Western goal you know like if that was your boyfriend you may or may not want to introduce him to your family right but the humans go on the other hand that that's a glass you get right there you can take that home to your mother if you guys google here man go I actually think they look really cool and wonder standing like on the rocks and you I walked right that one they're pretty big goals are big in general when you walk up to this especially dude the Western questions are westerns are huge like pterodactyls there other and their eyes are really pretty on the other eyes are already goals are really pretty yeah but the humans goal has that bright orange red orange red yeah oh yeah the bill yeah I was like I don't think their eyes are red no no their bills their bill is right there calls a little a lot different from the Western but it's more like a laughing goal yeah it's funny you guys so on one of the boats I worked on in the past you're not supposed to feed the birds but anyways we fed the birds so there's this one bird every well every single day his name was maverick and it's tough I've ever seen the goal with this guy now yeah I'm sort of like yeah it's like some sort of defects cuz I've seen on multiple anyways this guy's coming by and he likes Fritos in popcorn but he would fly by the window and you can his old hand out in married dudes sure enough like five days and right he was there nice yeah I didn't feel about it you know what other cool birds we've been seeing almost every day is black-footed albatross yeah oh wow like for the Albatross they're cool plenty shearwaters mers inside the harbor lately I'm expecting baby merge soon we saw something an exotic bird all right but sometimes a storm petrel oh that's right we don't know yeah it's too far away to tell but it wasn't that windy of a day either so we just wanted to come into the bay and visit yeah I don't even know what it was so it's all good it's been windy offshore so they probably getting pushed in a little bit probably yeah it's too dark to be a forked tail yeah the four tails are like light gray yeah exactly and they're a little bit bigger than the other ones too oh they are yeah not Hawaii my settings work on my stead oh you yeah yeah yeah take a look okay standby to standby so what is it I don't know it's the it's the back side of the bird basically it's it's a only bird but I'm not good at tail feather yeah go back one you got to put a Slater petrel show it depends it's not a fork - yeah it was really dark when I recall I'm pretty sure it was one of those Slater petrels I need more photography petrels no because like you know there's a Brownells so maybe I could just name this one cuz I got a photo of it really yeah that's what you think yeah and don't look at all my other photos is there a secret secret yeah look at your memory card um yeah no I don't know who is - no I'm not I'm no expert where's my camera so heavy dude you can't use heavy that's pretty quick well you guys it's been real oh you know we saw stellar sea lion on the buoys oh yeah I've seen Stella photo of it look at this look how big it is compared to the sea lion yeah that one didn't look big until actually like stirred up I was like yeah it got up I was like wow so much big I'm gonna use okay you guys the next podcast thing is gonna be this fuzzy little go oh do you guys agree I mean I guess I've only think in 53 photos in a week are you okay where's the real Slater what'd you do - um I got a temp gun didn't take your dude I think you're getting sick I just need some crazy whale action hopefully tomorrow you get it hey we had a question from one of our listeners right Eric oh yeah so one of our listeners Antonio thank you for being so loyal and listening and yeah you even came down force leaders all day so thanks for coming down but he had a a really basic but very good question and it really can you know drift off into so many other ways he's wondering about food availability you know how that really affects the whales my creations and lifestyle and stuff like that and that's simply how where it was like in the food chain yeah um you know what let me talk about this game this is science and I know so hit me with some facts later I'm ready don't worry but these whales definitely go where the food goes yep yeah so whether it's here or down south or in Santa Barbara or up north like down baxford let's just talk about them they definitely go where the food goes but the thing is is there's so much food in the bay right now and they're not all here they're down south so I don't know really just depends yeah it's really weird because the cooler water is usually more biologically active yeah more food but it seems like some places like Santa Barbara been really hot they're seeing animals in the double digit well okay so that temperature things like at quite a massive scale right like you could put the whole central California coast region and you could pin that from Santa Barbara up to Cordell Bank as one cent cooler productive area because the California Current moves things around a lot between those all those pulling once you're above the Bight - yeah it changes it up also right but you know the overall migration scheme of being in cold nutrient-rich water in the summer and then warm less productive water in the winter I think that was in my opinion which I got this mostly from Jim soon Mitch is that it used to be a factor that you was more in play during the last glacial maximum right like places like Oregon and Washington would not have been survivable for a calf definitely not Alaska for gray whales like in the winter right like two big two biggest storms two cold water sometimes loose ice floating so they had to go towards the equator for breeding it was just like no other option food or no food like you had to get out of the stormy weather to have calves and then you would go back up there once your calf was strong enough yeah because like the gray was leaving the water what I heard is they leave when the water starts freezing over right yeah they take their cues from the ice for coming back down yeah yeah some of it's probably diurnal you know like changes in daylight's yeah yeah yeah what's that do you think do you think that like say you know down south the waters a lot clearer because it's less nutrient rich yeah do you think that like when the anchovies or sardines are in those waters and it's super clear that like the humpbacks enjoy it more and they're gonna take advantage of it when it's there cuz they probably know it there's a lot here but maybe it's easier for them when it's super clear water I don't know cuz there's a like they're looking for it anyways yeah I don't know I mean like sensing it how big of a deal is that temperature changed to you because as you're gaining more weight in the summer like are you more uncomfortable by the end of it because you're better insulated like oh man it's freaking hot here like I want to eat here I'm too hot I wonder if it's a metabolism thing too warmer it is your metabolism deaths are going to overdrive to stay warm so maybe the food's being more efficiently absorbed you know we're getting more gaining weight faster you're not trying to warm up hmm but it seems like food is obviously foods live for these animals oh yes you know supermarket go get your food there we're searching or searching so whose life well and they have to eat so much every day to be prepared for migration that like you really just can't mess around you have to be in the best place yeah and then there's like the optimal size right like humpbacks are kind of the biggest you can be before you have to eat even in the wintertime like fin whales and blue whales probably feed in their breed groans but like even our you know like we've been talking about senator residents obviously food is obviously an issue now to them just true yeah I wonder what people are thinking about this long span was this the longest fansler be heard this is a longer span I think since I can't tell you the date but it's like one of the longest what are people starting this I think it is the longest they've ever not seen so the guy says what does everyone think up there hear any chatter about what everyone thinks up there is going on I think literally everyone's word is I hope they found food somewhere else yeah like cuz no one knows where they're at yeah you don't I mean like no one saw except for when Jay Pot showed up in Tofino or something like that while I was there last when I saw that white transient mm-hmm and before that we had l-pod on March 31st and so they didn't see him for how many was is that I don't know they said like 8 months or something yeah I feel like Sarah and Jeff said like not since November or something like yeah or January mmm it was like night I don't know it's like nine months something crazy so I don't know hopefully I think everybody's just saying they hope they found food maybe a half organ or somewhere else or straight out of what is that the Strait of Juan de Fuca or which one goes to the ocean up there don't they usually I'll leave out that to the main ocean they don't well just out to the open ocean you know yeah but hopefully they found food up there out there yeah but food does definitely drastically can affect these animals migrations in fact the gray whale situation you know obviously we got majority animals that are washing up are showing signs of malnutrition and it seems like some of the gray whales already have I think we talked to touched on us a little bit especially me and Caitlin about how that Pacific Coast feeding group the whales that don't go all the way up to Alaska it seems like that area that we thought was just like maybe around Oregon this is expanding or thing born in California maybe even you know southern British Columbia now so these animals are kind of you know realize hey maybe foods a little more abundant here I'll hang out here I did hear that scarback is back in Depoe Bay but it sounds like sightings are pretty slim so far for Oregon some are gray whales - there's only like six or less there's like one in Newport Newport Oregon - outside of like boiler Bay and then like two or three in front of Depoe Bay and that's kind of it and I'm wondering how also the you know that there's also that one group of gray whales that likes to stop by Washington that would be Island area for good yeah well if they're gonna get smarter one year and stay there a little extra longer before they head up north because it seems like now they go there for like a deep a little snack stop for about a month or so I would say and then they keep going is it around but February or so they always expect to see them then yeah we'll see man but yeah definitely food food is the main driver for I mean feeding and breeding is the main drivers for what most animals do including cetaceans and I think it definitely over time when these animals kind of catch on with things I think it'll definitely affect her my migration patterns and stuff if these changes are permanent well like the John kalmyk Edie's talk he already said it did affect the blue whales they're starting they're not we're not losing more of them they're just spreading out yeah they just get around a lot yeah they didn't stop going to Newport Beach California they just started spreading up and uh you know up and down those that's yeah that's why we're seeing them for two minutes and they leave us and blues yeah they they they constantly eat you know it's not just you know oh the breeding grounds we're just gonna do this but yeah they're constantly going after food I have a question since we were talking about the metabolism in the warm water mm-hmm do you think that the humpbacks can only be there for so long because they got a start they got to be burning calories like crazy the males are chasing each other they're breaching the mom and the babies are breaching like oh like down on the breeding grounds you mean yeah anywhere like what let's say Hawai for instance it's warm water yeah I mean but they're also c'mon dude I don't know they're also resting a lot - yeah yeah I can go both ways and I think they get like a hormone surge that kind of suppresses their appetite - and we have found out I'm not sure which population of humpback it is but they have found like during certain times in a migration there is like literally a snack spot where they're still feeding I'm trying to recall which population I mean I believe ours do that yeah it's a population I want to say it's a centered hem some of our ones down towards South America but they found the area where they like they're eating here well that's kind of like this sardine run right like that's kind of halfway between the feeding grounds in Antarctica and the breeding grounds that they go to off the coast of Africa they kind of stopped there for the sardine run and then keep going and ours are going to Mexico and you're not going to knock it but it seems like they're totally opportunistic to just because you know we're reading field guides and stuff they say only feet here and only breed here if they see a good easy you know you're sure go for it for sure if they're in the breeding grounds and there's a nice patch of fish that's easily accessible why wouldn't you yeah and that's why even our gray whales you know we said I always say oh they go to the coastline and go to the bottom but my said shrimp even those pelagic crabs have been seen you know being picked off yeah photos from Monterey of them skim feeding at the surface for krill yep yeah totally what trips me out the most about roar cual whales in particular is how do they detect patches of prey like okay they're paper came out last year about blue whales finding food based on memory right so they go on places where they found food before let's say okay let's go to Monterey Bay Monterey Bay still a huge place how did you find that one patch of krill did you hear it did you feel it do you have a sense that we don't have like how how did you find that patch of food that's what I don't get that you know we talked about the really basic stuff like you know tubercles with two hairs but I also kind of mention them right now and then about the dimethyl sulfide thing you heard about that where when plankton breaks down it creates a gas and we think our whales might be able to kind of every time they kind of with that maybe travel in that direction okay but if curls 150 meters down which is like typical blue whale foraging depth does it really make that much of a smell that you can tell where it is that area in general should be more biologically active and the krill are gonna be feeding on below the photogate even that you know is gonna hit this it's gonna be towards the surface the opposite way and the humpback signo can never smell the food yeah I travel in circles to the wind that's why they're always moving - yeah I mean that's just one of the questions that it still remains unanswered but it's just kind of cool to just think about it for yeah I know people have a lot of questions like some people asked if they can taste it and you know researchers have looked people who are studying anatomy I look closely a whale's tongue and it turns out those taste buds are more what salty and saltier eyes shades of grey you know it's not like they're going mmm this is krill water I'm gonna head this way so they're not cut they're colorblind I mean yeah I think I think so looking at their yeah looking at see my rosy cheeks yeah looking what the hell well graded yeah gray maybe about fifty warm I did hat - good at - you didn't wear camo so the whales couldn't see you know dang I wonder what they would think of that what if I wore all gray that I'd be invisible you might be maybe like green screen right through me but hey you know this brings up a neat little thing if you guys have heard of this different theories about you know how wills find food or anything like that or you know how it affects their lifestyle migration yeah chime in right us DMS or whatever that way we kept more fun things to talk about you know I guess say you're always says we do this for fun we're not experts but yeah the more input the better yeah I mean especially whales that are finding food in the in the open water column like gray whales that to me I could see how you could maybe hone in on some some ideas of the right you know benthic habitats and things like that right whales kind of just seem to skim feed all the time because they're going for copepods which just basically always at the surface but Wells are finding stuff at depths that are not echolocating let me know I need to know let me know hey guys well I think we should wrap this episode up yeah man have a great trip I know I'm excited we coming up Friday at 9:05 p.m. okay not too long no you can go with Caitlin and pick me up that'd be fine Friday at 9 o'clock yeah all right you guys I was just singing something okay ready if you guys made it this far in the podcast and as a listener go to our Instagram and tell us your favorite whale ooh yeah Anna radish the topic if you're a real boss bonus points for that one but tell us your favorite whale when we post this on Monday yep that'd be really cool and yeah make sure you follow us on Instagram it's whale nerds also episode 27 we figured out what's wrong with it for those of you that were worried about Spotify we did resolve that old difficulties but thank you we're learning they export it as the wrong file we got it we got it figured out it's reloaded so good awesome all right guys thanks for listening and once again the app you never come by the Monterey area I'm glad you guys are introducing yourselves feel free to do so it seems like you guys are coming from literally all around the world so to this area they go well watching and actually listening to our tips yeah thank you remember take your camera lens hood off and turn your camera on your camera have a good one you guys fire

hello everyone and welcome back to the well Nerds podcast this is episode number 29 29 my name is Slater and I'm here with Eric and Kaitlin hey everyone hello and we all had a great week of well watching oh yeah right yeah cool stuff everywhere everywhere everywhere even in Alaska oh yeah and I went to Alaska oh no people were there on Instagram mm-hmm the Grahams hmm yeah wants to go first there goes what did you see I do um a lot of humpback whales humpback whales seem to really the numbers really picked up the last few days we were I told you guys they would come back that's where I was not here watching them but the humpbacks have and I look back to my logs a year ago it's like double digit days every day and it wasn't like that for a while but last few days yes back in a double digits or a few days that we had close to 30 animals out there today there were times we have about 20 around us but they're feeding with the good old sea lions again singing about a lunge feeding and one highlight of my last few days that everyone's mad at me about is a I'm closing my ears leatherback sea turtle is the first one for whale watching boats out here this this season confirmed at least and it was a pretty big individual about probably about five and a half feet long total length and it showed really well but yeah it was one of the first ones and for those you who know about turtles yeah our Pacific leatherback population isn't doing too hot so seeing one that's pretty rare we think only about a hundred come into this area the total population the Pacific might only be about 2,000 animals and most of the turtles we see here are actually nesting off of Southeast Asia coastline so sri lanka as far as indonesia on that area and is that mm that's not females right well that's the thing only because I know they only count that's kind of a guest of the total but yeah when you count Turtles you know you're gonna go for the easy ones or which are on the beach and obviously there's gonna be all females so getting a male count is kind of difficult well in there there they may have a skewed ratio now because the warming temperatures on the beach the eggs if they're warm are born one gender than the other and sea turtles themselves are just so hard to to study at times especially a letter back because they're true you know pelagic sea turtle being literally out in the middle of nowhere at time so tracking is being done and if the you know researcher has as funding for example out here you know that person who's really into him was a gentleman from NOAA Scott Benson he's the one who was really watching Turtles out here and tagging a few particular individuals and he actually has access to a small plane that he'll fly around Central California to to track them down yeah I know they saw I think one or something in the Half Moon Bay turtle survey mm-hmm and they saw lots of mullahs and then the sea nettles starting to move down the coast and then they started reporting the sea nettles up in Santa Cruz and then down in Moss Landing and then you guys saw the tree yeah that's what I've been hearing a for some reason the Monterey area Moss Landing area we're not seeing many many jellies of any sort but yeah seems like our buddy is just a little bit further north over there in Santa Cruz are getting the jellies and there was a one verified report from a fisherman who actually sent some cellphone photos to some of us whale watching folks and after that yeah we were the first whale watching boat to officially spot one so good sighting super rare animal that you know was facing a lot of issues out here as far as climate change even plastics in the water so we don't know how you know stable door numbers are we used to think the Atlantic population was doing really well people always say oh they're doing good but now there's some talk that it might not be doing too hot so letter backs Walt sea turtles in general or animal we should be highly concerned about yeah and I know a lot of people asked no I did not see I was on the oh so you saw sweet early are they I didn't get to go see it we were too far away well maybe next time probably not though Wow I'll call you I'll call you when I see one no okay well you know what jelly I hope comes back this year instead of the net old circle stripe no they are pretty bellies no cross jelly peanut butter and jelly yeah no I want the egg yolk jelly oh yeah guess where I just saw want to your island yeah yeah that one there available up there since it's seems expir more abundant it has it's cooler is it I only saw one but they had a lot of uh a lot of them when it was warm a lot a little clear jellies and they look like glass drops or that small mm-hmm cross chops across dock cross costume oh yeah crest top is like I don't know what a cross top is some type of clothes item okay cross top is like okay like you know how we give her a dog medicine for anxiety it's it's crossed across the top so you can break it into corners yeah thank you pharmacist later now back to the well nerds anyway look like girls but they were just small and clear but they're really pretty maybe there's some kind of comb jelly or umbrella joke right there they're not like tough enough to comb your hair you said it yeah they didn't stink no I saw them right where I was getting on the sea play net so you just saw jellies in San Juans right cuz that's what people go to San Juan Islands for yeah that's all I wanted tell me what I'm garter snakes thanks Anna quacks and a fox a fox one Fox and I saw super super ultra rare chance to kill her whoa whoa no wait so did you really see the ones that we saw down yeah so you only did I see the ones you saw there I saw their entire family that's so cool guess what you guys well you're something so crazy yes so we saw shoot I need another name which ones were they that you saw here 34 I'm opening it up seven bees and then we saw okay so 34 37 bees they think they're all family but they were just talking about at different times can they go in order I've ever seen so anyways those two are together right six miles north of them are the 37 days no way and they were headed towards each other well then the 34 and 37 bees just stopped completely stopped and we're like okay maybe they're like calling them in you know and I've never seen this and people on the radio they were saying they've never seen this and the guys like I'm in the 13 years and on and on the radio you're saying this he's like and I've never seen killer whales all of them just sat completely at the surface logging all of them that's cool literally not like they were taking breaths but they were just blow all out dorsal fin out like flat weird isn't that weird and for like not just like a second for like minutes cool yes later so yeah when we talked on the phone so the reason why this this slater's sighting is so significant is because we saw those transient orcas down here June 17 since I was yeah the t-34s t37 and t37 a's so less than a month there and let's see we can adjust in there that's kind of I think it's like Google 100 it's like 1,200 miles or something wow that's so awesome to see it well that you sauce if you guys saw so when I saw them so they just put out a new catalog I'm up there which is so cool you guys it has not only all left and right dorsum saddles but it also has eyepatch --is oh cool for almost all of them only like a few se-na but it has basically everybody saddle and eyepatch which is on both sides is that available too yeah I don't know what the name of their project was called but it's Gary J 27 on Instagram oh yeah yeah and him and his girlfriend Taz Lea Shaw and someone else Gary's photos are like every single one is like yeah he was like how does he do that well he's we found out that he's been I came just kidding he's been rubbing seed oil on the pot yeah so um but yeah that was really cool and so then we went up to the other pod the 37 days that were part of that family you know but split off and they started where we're coming that way for a little while we ended up getting like a couple spy hops and tail throws and then they hunted a harbor harbor seal right in front of us mm-hmm and I'm pretty sure I saw it like drape it across his head one of their and then dude they came out around the corner and went the opposite way voom they don't even meet up how fun is that yeah pretty full oh yeah but why didn't they meet up at their family yeah they're probably like oh I don't want to see my aunt I gotta go so that was pretty cool into like this gorgeous orange that you know picture this yeah and the one dorsal fins are good-looking that I think that was the night that we saw them you know what we should we should put out like so we mentioned that you saw whales that were here up all the way up there before that I think was your trip we had the T 165 166 that was the all-day trip yeah I wonder like we should that have our listeners pay attention to see when those every spot up north be kinda cool to know when they pop up again yeah but those ones were like way up they said like Alaska like really yeah those ones were from like more of they're more seen in Alaska and the last time was like 10 years before that we have a raster listeners hey guys look for these whales ti1 66 and 166 day I was doing the math the whales would have had to travel at least 50 miles a day to get back to the San Juan Islands in that short amount of time Wow so they just beelined it up probably yeah isn't that cool yeah oh and by the way so in that cup this is what I was getting to in the catalog Sara had actually written in there the calf number cuz it wasn't in the catalog had just been finished right before you guys had seen it and you guys were the first to see that calf down here in Monterey no way yeah so then we were there second up there isn't that cool yeah that little that little orange thing was cute and it was less orange I think now - yeah that's a it was a tiny it's a 500k it showed so well - yeah yeah 785 it showed well really well and that pod was just rinky-dink whales really small whales I remember you know what I saw it was pretty much all well there was males and they were either really young or it was all female types all the pods I saw up there I did see a lot of the pods twice the only pod that I saw that had a male and it was just 65 age and a2 was the male 65 a - mm-hmm and yeah that was only male I saw first okay so the first trip we go on literally with these whales and it's two two and one they're all spread out like within like a quarter mile of each other and the man will take about a mile and a half away he was pretty far away and then all the smaller ones the four ended up meeting up and the male stayed off and we're watching and watching and watching right well we're done watching them so we'll go see the male and then check him out on our way home and so right when we turn towards the male the the four just start going different all went different directions at the same time and then next thing you know heart porpoise comes flying out of the water so then we're like never mind so we turn back and watch and watch that and I was like I was like everybody I bet you this male is gonna come here in just a second next thing you know comes right past us in like wow within like three or four minutes it took him then he just kind of zoomed over cool came right across the boat yeah so that was really cool so that was our first trip on that water and then actually the next morning I don't think we had killer whales in the morning we did have two trips where we didn't see killer whales out of the aid but you saw it whales yeah we had humpbacks and minke whales nice yeah your humpbacks into breaching right yeah the humpback well we hadn't well the humpbacks were all really mellow until our very last trip okay so we were being so like we're like we meet a briefs like a killer well breach you mean like out of eight trips and we see killer whales every time it's like you need one we were just being greedy yeah we were getting some spy hops and stuff and then so on our last trip we saw no killer whales but the humpbacks went nuts huh so that was really cool I don't know so let me tell you guys the ferry kind of rounded at an island the huge the bc ferry which is huge way bigger than like the ferries I just go from Anacortes to huh which are huge yeah and as soon as it rounded the corner and it got like in line with the humpbacks the humpbacks like started it like they both down back kind of arch their back you know they do that crazy arch yeah where they lift their head out of the water and then archery like that yeah exactly and everybody someone described they were like it just did this behavior and I think it's kind of a breach get ready sure enough boom comes flying out of the water it was just like that morning we had here and the whale did it right next to bow and then I said everybody look and it flew out of the water that's cool that behavior must just say like I'm going downhill fast no time for this yeah when you see him speed I'm coming for ya and so it was a calf and I don't know it was just a juvenile because I think the one the one that I was next to ended up being a because people had a nice ferry trip I wouldn't even notice yeah there was literally 250 people yeah like it's funny cuz I just got the front of the ferry the name of it and the way of reaching to the ferry company no maybe notice I know sometimes certain times of years there's actually at least on the US side some of the ferries going to the San Juans actually have naturalist on them yeah volunteers walking around yes what I wonder nickel is because I know the ferry it we know the ferry is pretty loud yeah I wonder if it was like this is annoying and they jump out of the water because the water is just pecks lapping he would if he was annoyed he probably have been you know trying to freaking bring his head up out of the water right or it could have been like hey I'm over here so that's what I think I was like I'm here I'm here yeah thing but then they always stay we're talking about killer whales they said sometimes in the ferries go by and they like will run over to the wake cuz they push a huge way yeah a deep one where it's like big you know yeah and so I was wondering maybe they just like were like oh time to play kind of thing to be so cool one two times in the last five years that like we've been transiting the area on the whale watch like at full speed which is like a whole 12 knots but you don't see a like while you're transiting and then it whale will breach like less than a hundred yards away and then the captain not obviously takes out of gear and I think that's the whale like hey I was sleeping over here like yeah don't hit me I don't know that's my that's my take on it sometimes yeah I think it was I'm over here your main keys at school just beaming um so we were just we did like morning trip after and then in an evening we skipped the lunch one every day I couldn't one o'clock or two whatever it was and at in the middle of the day they had lunch feeding minke whales oh no way yeah yeah you're biased it's fine we no no I like minke whales like my feet I would go for that yeah no I definitely want to see it like after we sell because you don't spend the full time with killer whales you check them out then you give them their space you know right so I was like like after some of the trips we went into all birds or we went did a thing exile harbor seals or whatever was around there so like I'll take it but I want to get the killer whales in first because sometimes they're weighed their you know weigh different areas like the minke whales are out in this Strait and the other ones are just going wherever they feel like the transients my gosh Caitlin how did your trips get pretty good sea turtles no hey you guys saw blue well I was gone yeah I did yeah so our other boat that same day when I saw the blue whale they also saw some fin whales but we left I was on a 10 o'clock charter with some kids in the summer camp so we did get the blue whale and then we got some good looks at humpbacks did you get anything well pics dorsal picks you guys had a fin whale - uh-huh no I didn't see it no okay I just saw the blue whale but I don't know if the naturalist on the other boats got the fin whale pics or not there was four of them but I did see a new humpback whale calf that I've officially named chunky visit the lumpy one of the one that's a dorsal fin the one missing the hump before the dorsal fin is I said story no I know Lumpy's are different well what do you call that cat I was gonna talk about that guys did you see it yeah so I got a picture of it's mom's tail flukes today oh man so Bob yeah yeah oh did you already submit too happy well yeah so I know Ted wants to know who it is the calf so it showed up on Wednesday last week we saw it and I got a picture of its tail but not its mom and then we saw him again today and I got a picture of the moms tail cuz she did a tail throw once she had a huge fluke - it was like black with white and then like black there's a couple sets of lines I had some cool markings yeah yeah it was really cool fluke so the calf came up next to another whale in the feeding frenzy when we were with it and the mom did tail throw which is how I got her fluke photo and the calf immediately left the other whale and went over to her so I think the mom was like hey get over here that's funny yeah it's funny cuz they were like there was two humpbacks what we left because we remember we're there in the beginning and then we took off to go explore yeah that's her Eric and then we went in and then when we came back it was just two humpbacks feeding and then the mom and calf were like in the same area but they were like coming in and then going out and like coming in and going out they weren't like in the midst of it with the other yeah we like when we were with them they were in it they were all in all the very beginning right after you guys left okay yeah they came back in so I'm calling the calf chunky because it's like hold dorsal hump is cut off its back like it has that little stub left to the back of the dorsal fin but it's got this big chunk dug out there and it's asymmetrical the left side doesn't look as bad as the right side did you see the the fluke on the calf mm-hmm killer whale rake marks on the left side one on the right side it has like same kind of like scarring like you know when they have a deck after they've been disentangled it looks like it's rubbed it raw for a long time oh yeah on the front of the right side of the flute it has a big rub marks but I think it looks more like the color of where the chunk is missing yeah Kate comes and I've been exchanging photos and it has the killer whale break marks on both sides of the Fluke dang that that's a mom mm-hmm yeah and then this is the mom breaching she's really right on the belly oh cool and white pectoral thing so be interesting to see if Ted knows who the whale is he hasn't got happy well hasn't pinged on it oh really yeah a bunch of us submitted photos so but I'm saying you haven't got a result yet yeah I think they're they might be running a little bit behind they're still a few days mom yeah it doesn't I mean it looks like a very recognizable well but it doesn't look like a whale I've seen before yeah I think they're getting a lot of submissions from us moderate folks right now since everyone's back and out in force yeah a lot of the regulars are back in the area Fran yeah I saw Frank last week angel wing akimbo major wins here wait didn't angel we have a cap washer yeah no calf is over there so I'm sure there is something interesting about Julie like angel wings dude I forgot don't you have a cap with her last year I don't know Oh was she the Catholics jazz has lumpy yes yes has that really bumpy looking little calf that's super active mm-hmm so those are the two mom and calf pairs right now lumpy and chunky why do you get the name whales because I saw it first I never know whales well you should submit to happy with good name one of the whales Eric go ahead you guys kind of it's you did but okay oh how are you guys are my interns um but yeah so I was looking for a happy we'll enter other than that we had good dolphin action with Rizzo's a couple times since last episode and then I had a really good encounter with coastal bottlenose dolphin today so we were coming back in yeah we were coming back in a little bit earlier than Eric's boat because a lot of our people were not feeling very good so we did a little coastal tour and we stopped off at the kelp beds and we're looking at sea otters and I was kind of talking about like conservation and stuff and we're about to leave the sea otters and I was like stop stop stop Danny there's bottlenose dolphin so he turned and we we were watching them as a group of like seven and they were like coming towards the boat and they were circling and they were like playing with each other and like yeah we got to watch him for like ten minutes which was really cool most of the time you lose them after like two or three minutes yeah any cabs no but there was one younger one okay yeah we've actually seen coastal bottlenose two or three times since you were gone Slater two times right out in front of the harbor and then we had that really nice encounter today I get just later they're like cleaners gone we got to hang out I got a photo with four mammals in it today but they're not mammals you would expect it's a human a sea otter a harbor seal and a bottlenose dolphin a lot of mammal age there oh yeah person in the kayak was sitting outside the kelp beds fishing and there's an otter next to him a harbor seal popped up next to him and then the dolphin swims by that's pretty good Wow so one thing that's been happening out here two days in the row they seen the white sharks yeah and yesterday there was a predation of a sea lion or something yeah according to one of the captains literally it sounds sad but half a sea line popped up next to them and the white shark came up and I want to see that there's some pretty big sharks around yeah then today it's super warm and there's no predators yeah whew a few of the beaches up a little bit further north of us like over there in Sea Cliff and Aptos have already put up signs warning people yeah well everybody's doing shark tours up there now and there's a lot of juvenile sharks being sighted but also I've heard 10 and up to 14 feet long sharks reported in the last year that's already mammal eating size there that's pretty pretty cool recive I can't wait to see one I know we'll see one soon on a whale watch you haven't seen a white shark eater not this season okay of course I've been oh my god we gotta find a new whale Marika's Kayla never sees any of animal what is it to become a welder must have seen a leatherback sea turtle Wow then the whale nurse is gonna be real small people cuz there's not that many leatherbacks one thing I still need to see is a basking shark me too thank you muting me body I told you to send one to Monterey she had a really nice trip with a friendly minke well yesterday with Island Packers you guys see that yeah yeah that was lunch meeting or something it was like spy hoppy and she said just friendly with the boat what it is if Mickey's are pretty consistent over there in the channel Oh Jen Islands man we were driving and then this pinky just popped up right one of us I know because I flew forward and dude we stopped and this Mickey well went like across the bow then he came back and then he went away and then he came back anyway and then he came back and then he left he was going to check you out super curious yeah I swear they're either the worst in the most elusive animal to see or they gate in Monterey they're always elusive I've never had a clue like I've had maybe too close passes at the minke whale and most I think they were all on accident you do get opposite days I remember like literally one of my first few trips out here we had great showing Mickey's and great showing harbour porpoise like together you're like what the heck's going on opposite world there were a lot of harbours in the San Juan Islands you guys mm-hmm and every time we were in like a strait or something there was like tons of our purpose oh the other day what day was it yesterday in the afternoon maybe two days ago we had like 10 harbour porpoise fly through the feeding frenzy with um sea lions and humpbacks and everybody was like dolphins dolphins and I was like oh my gosh those are actually harbour porpoise they're just showing like really well that's funny that was pretty neat yeah the ones I saw showed really well too because there's flat calm no because they were getting eaten oh that - they're flying out of them they're consumed yeah it is pretty interesting when they do that when they hunt other odontocetes though cuz they really do have to make it a big show because you thought this is it just grabbing like it's a chicken wing chicken not even a chicken tender a marshmallow with the harbor's there got to be a little tougher like you know to bite through the harbour porpoise they got more bones and stuff right um no but their skins thicker like I feel like a harbor seal skin actually rips pretty easily what I'm just thinking about this we're talking about scienter so you ever see that video are we still getting ripped apart by those two Orca yeah no but I've seen the video of them like pushing it past the boat and the harbor seals like say you watch that video I saying yesterday oh yeah where was that killer Ellen the wakeboard Annie border Danny border yeah - this new border fell off the knee board the killer wall comes up and flips upside down is looking right at his knee border and the boat is like trying to drag the the rope back up yeah that wrote back to the knee border and then it's awesome and then the killer whale goes over and like checks out the handle on the rope uh-huh and then what's a Colwood happened okay following the and then she got back up on the knee board to grab the rope and the boat started to pull away but didn't even jet off or anything really it just slowly started pulling away and pulling the knee border the killer was kicking really hard right underneath upside-down following the knee border yeah that's funny freaking cool that's oh and then speaking of videos so what did you want to talk about that maybe you shouldn't be this morning oh yeah there was a video in Alaska someone shared today and the killer whale was like just spyhopping next to the boat and then just sitting like real close total like what was that one whale Luna it was like doing that and they reached out touched it and then it pulled back but then it just stayed there and then like it kind of went up again the killer went up again and then it just flips up it flips upside down and actually shows his teeth a little bit and then it's just like resting upside down and they're like splashing in the water and then it like blows bubbles I don't I think it was playing around interesting I don't think it showed I said show teeth but just because I get opened his mouth exactly show teeth so it wasn't like it was like growling or anything Wow but I don't know it was pretty cool so that actually brings up a point where I had someone asked me where do we find like our whale news yeah oh yeah so many sources that was just on the Facebook page orcas yeah but I don't know whose video was so sorry there are accounts that you can follow like that do post lots of different videos about ocean stuff and specifically whale stuff or even specifically killer whale stuff and a lot of times they'll like credit or source the video so you can kind of go back to the original person and maybe get like the original caption of what happened and what day some of it you do have to take with a grain of salt especially if it's coming off of social media but yeah a lot of research agencies also have social media pages now too because they understand that like they have to share their work with where the people are so like even Cascadia has an Instagram you know yeah and I do want to say don't reach out and touch an orca if it's bugging your boat he saw the video but he's not saying doing yeah it was yeah I don't recommend it at all but yeah it was pretty crazy yeah there is nuts yeah send it to me dude send you some links but otherwise online resources um Eric and I mention every few episodes Marvin because it not only does it have like jobs and internships it also has like recent papers and other things yeah what else where else do you find stuff people send us news Omar man people send this stuff but I like really trustworthy sources I mean unfortunately social media so you know widely available with so many different sources some of the stuff is just like baloney yes even the ones you think are legit like I'll be honest if you read things like you know that I F word love science that has some questionable even that sometimes that's questionable yeah like they kept on talking about that that jelly that lives forever you know they don't kind of tell people that only it's a clone in a yeah in a in a you know controlled environment in the lab and its really kind of just backtracking in life instead of living forever so yeah be careful where you get your stuff from like I always say on the boat I try not to say anything that they can't back up with a paper yeah yeah and and for us we're we're so fortunate to live like where the researchers are based out of for a lot of the stuff so we get information like straight from them sometimes but also like attending American cetacean Society meetings or conferences or going to Marine Mammal conference or things like that you know like Marine Mammal conference they have this year they think they have 1900 posters and speed talks imagine how much information you could absorb in just the posters and speed talks and some of you probably wondering like where would you find where these conferences are but that like Caitlin said earlier Marmara and Mar man that is such a great resource it's simply a email mailing list out there and a lot of people try to avoid spam but this is good stuff that you're looking forward to seeing and even some like good events like well fest or was the festival of whales they had on Southern California I know they have them in other places around the world there's European cetacean Society there's a society for me mammalogy so some of those orgs have events that are like more community engaging but also do have a like a lecture component and I think some people get kind of intimidated going to these things because they think you have to be you know marine biologist or someone really into the field lot of them welcome you know you know the general public because we do want people to get educated and you know spread the word about some of the issues or whales we are dealing with especially like ACS conferences what every two years Caitlin that we just came back from it yes yeah those are more you know I think suitable for the general public and also you know people in the field or researcher or people who are biologists and stuff like that and simple things like even ACS meetings depending on where you're located especially having a West Coast every major city is gonna have AC s meetings and those things are unbelievable usually sometimes your your idols will show up there mm-hmm that's a good segue into another topic suggestion we had Erik idols so I had someone a message the whale nerd to Instagram and said they had just been to super pod super pod six oh cool last year and they got to meet a few of their heroes in the field and so they wanted to hear our stories about who and why and what about our ocean heroes made us like inspired in the field or became why they became our heroes I know you worshipped like Jon callimachus you know yeah yeah I worship Jon cuz I don't know if he's a God of big whale research out there he's got a cool beard too he does he's really nice too he's a nice guy nice guy he's uh when we go to these conferences and listen to him talk you know he's he makes everything really simple he's got to meet stories yeah he's a good communicator for sure exactly that's what I like about him and then I'm from the conservation standpoint this might get a little controversial but I really like the guys who keep it on subject when they're talking about conservation especially what nowadays when we talk about captivity they are whaling and stuff like that like Ric O'Barry he seems to be take a good approach with stuff like that and I like him because you can see how he changed over the years you know those who really know who Ric O'Barry is I mean this guy you know he he's mentioned quite a few times yeah look I just finished exactly the book flipper you know it's all it was all him but now he kind of talks about a different message about conservation and and I just like how how his approaches you know he's really taking on the actual subject matter not attacking attacking certain groups like some organizations out there you know more approaching the problem mm-hmm mine I don't know here's a photography here's a here's a weird word for me to think of but the first person that really got me into whales was jim's image oh yeah great well King I worship just say that he would like King of Great God of great yeah he's a really I don't know he made this subject of marine mammals just very approachable and mysterious and fun and if I hadn't taken his class I don't think I would have switched my major to marine biology mm-hmm and I love running into him at conferences and oh yeah it's just like he's always so happy to see me and it's like you know it's really neat he's just a really nice guy and but as far as who could I listen to talk about whales all day it's actually her cost me no listen do you talk about whales all day whether I want to or not is actually Shane Garrow he's a Dominica sperm whale project yeah yeah I'm sorry works for Department fisheries and oceans in Canada yeah and I had no idea that he was such a great science communicator but like I got goose bumps the first time I heard him talk about his whales he's just like they're like his family and he talks about them like they're his loved ones and like it's really captivating and I I wish he had the ability to reach a wider audience I really hope he does mm-hmm because I think he would be one of those people that would inspire a movement to like really save those sperm whales and yeah he's really I idolized his ability to communicate a story like that that's another cool thing about our field is you go if you guys go to these conferences these people are literally just like right there you can approach them talk to them email them yeah yeah that's a fun thing about our field didn't have bodyguards around them what are you looking at me Slater here I don't know he doesn't get nervous he's pretty cool yeah yeah later Gary Gary B's video Saturday 27 of that every picture he takes he could probably be blindfold on taking awesome work of pictures somehow I don't know who my hero is Jaime Jaime myself I'm always striving to be better actually you know they said that it's not how he says it at all seven way cooler who's the guy in uh shoes he's in wolf of Wall Street but he's in the bath you makan what is it Matthew McConaughey oh yeah he says where he's like I'm I hear Wall Street says that during acceptance speech doesn't yeah that's mine like I follow so many people it's like hard to choose yeah like I like all of the call I have a fault so many different conservationists and then I fall so many different like marine life photographers and then I fall so many just added like inspiring people so I think it's about Soviet girl yeah she's a badass chick like I just don't really badass dude she's like fearless anybody says I'll get back to this question on the next episode we ambushed you with that one she gave you some time to think about it another I mean I always whenever I have an opportunity I am always pleased to hear Ari Friedlander Jeremy gold bogan and Ted Cheeseman talk yeah just because they have the greatest visual so like if it's I don't know if that makes them your hero but I there I like I enjoy listening like to move into John's you know talk or when we listen TED talk you know oh man we gonna hear all of these different discoveries you know the ATS amazing so they're all my heroes anyone working towards the ocean yeah you know and helping it why you're here kindness it's Caitlin you're here they're like low on the polaric Wow oh my at least medium yes fine oh no fair there what's all my animal of I was gone Eric did not watch all the Kevin was afraid of your snake dude I was playing zookeeper all week it was scary and your dog coming out at our shots like seconds ago my house whew staring at me every time I looked in the game oh god I can't sleep it's really loud can someone fix the hydrophone in the bay please oh oh yeah down because they're doing a whole bunch of stuff right now they're doing that spring migration study and barri what do you need so I'm down a sale drone a couple like two weeks ago yeah I have to point it out to rod the other day so I didn't hit it yeah and barri oh yeah I pointed out to John the other day too if you're listening out we'll fix your hydrophone I could swim down there darling more so that it's directional someone told me that they were thinking of putting an array down there not just one that'd be cool whose it was installing yeah I'll see anybody out there from Caltrain the Western flyer out there doing that kind of stuff they have been out for a few days yeah yeah if someone go down there and like drilling into this know as submersible goes down there and does it know yeah yeah someone go in it no don't don't Teddy ROV all right well we have more questions go for him yeah um so how do we had a listener from Norway asked how we name the orcas out here I think we got like three or four of those messages in the last week yeah actually we did get this question kind of often so a lot of the time when we're saying ID numbers of whales we're talking about California pigs or transient killer whales California being a loose term because they are cited other places but they were documented in a California catalog in the late 90s and a lot of the whales only have ID numbers they don't have names so we just go off the CA fifty ones or see 140s and unfortunately the catalogue is still from 1997 so if you want to learn about it's never been updated and so a lot of the whales that we actually see on a regular basis were born after the catalog was published so I know a lot of people really want to learn more about the whales but there's no official ID catalog my demos done get some more eye patches in the mines day yeah sure hope someone I have heard that some people are working on one so admit we may have some more information on that sometime but yeah we'll see we'll see yeah I was hoping they would add ours is the one up north and then we would have it done I know it's frustrating for people if you can't look up that particular resource yourself I totally understand why we're getting a lot of questions about it but unfortunately it's just something that we know from working on the ocean but there is no actual updated resource for it or with people who have seen them and then they can tell us who they are right yeah yeah that's the only way very very quickly guys the backtrack it just popped up in my head if you're local to the central California area and barri that we just talked about is actually having their open house on the 20th 20th on Saturday oh you know what though 20 is that this area July 20th is also the ACS Monterey Bay barbecue fundraiser okay so barbecue I'm on my way okay cool where's this at an Indian village I'm probably working is it near here yeah I'm Pebble Beach Oh free cuz you know uh barbecue yeah the one that went to last year yeah sorry I'm Bari we're not going to open house we're going ACS Monterey barbecue Oh wonder both I'm not going anything cuz I'm working I don't think I can go to both I have to set up for the barbecue um another question was article uh marine mammal acoustics topics websites apps and things where you can listen hydrophones monterey bay aquarium minbari they did have a live stream one they still have their sound library of through their website I believe so you can listen to previously recorded things there are several hydrophones up in the Salish Sea as well that live stream right yeah yeah I can't find a website that's like I think they're very like local I don't think theirs is big as like in Bari so I don't know like their website isn't as easy to use okay so I haven't found any but yeah there used to be one that was off a lion kill in different areas it's still there that's how they decided to come in yeah but I don't recall the links but I'm sure our Google Savi friends can probably find it themselves yeah if we hear more we will let you know we did have the hydrophone 10 while I was on the boat up there transients don't talk that much but after they kill something they do young man my gosh it's so cool when you hear them huh yeah it's like when they do they're like please buy a purse I don't know why I really like spy hops from there they look cool when they do it killer whales in general or just up there killer whales general oh okay yeah I was like wait maybe buddy's talking to this while the hydrophones down there it didn't work it's funny cuz I was like so we were like our whole thing was like we'll just have this this good energy and we're always like yeah they're gonna breach today like it's gonna be awesome and so at the final end of the trip my friend leave that one with me goes honey you should they were gonna breach like 12 times this trip and none of them breach and literally he like pretended to yell mad at me the humpback comes flying out of the water and I was like and then he was like whoa I was like dude I told you is gonna breach cuz that's what I said I was like it's gonna breach she's like you said that 12 time's flew out he's like well I just need yeah yeah no see I can talk to whales wow you came back from the San Juan Islands fluent in whale yeah but it's only a Pacific Northwest so they only go big well guess what you might see some of our whales their contacts yeah because yeah they're seeing some that go to Mexico and some I go to Hawaii mm-hmm so that'd be kind of cool mm-hmm would you guys be down with that yeah be cool I mean I asked you when you came back my words I did you happy well I got some clues to spot good look up one happy well though the name two spots that's your spot see if it's bent where it's been yeah I don't know Big Mama she's from what they got she goes on Hawaii I think tell the story Big Mama all right so I don't know the dates though but I think it was like in the 90s so same in the sailors she is like most of the places along well anywhere the the whales were completely decimated and they were hunted out of the area and there was no humpbacks left and then in like the 90s I believe this whale Big Momma showed up by herself and then she left and then two years later they didn't see her for two years and then she came back with a calf and then every other year since then she's came back with a calf except for the last few years they said she hasn't had a calf with her but they believe that she was the first whale to come back in a sailor she and every year she's brought in more whales with her and then those whales have brought in more whales and they think that she pretty much like invited people to that area so they're like really loved Big Momma she definitely brought seven calves there yeah which is a lot okay so later here's your two spot well for some reason I'm happy well it shows it just hanging out in Pacific Northwest it may it may not have been documented in there because in Hawaii yeah maybe they've only seen it there all over look at that that's it only sightings from the Big Mama oh yeah that was two spots yeah our two spot yeah okay so Big Momma Big Poppa Big Momma here we go Wow Hawaii yeah that cool dang how many sightings that have of her 51 what was the first one so Eric's on happy well calm and if you guys have not been on there well than BC yeah you know it's super cool that you guys can do if you hear us a like a humpbacks name and we say it by their name like you know Fran angel wing or something like that you can look them up and sometimes there'll be a double you know account for that whale just like maybe somewhere else has the same like the Pacific Northwest or something pretty good with putting no putting parentheses like you know British Columbia Mexico yeah a California or something though but yeah you guys could totally look up unhappy world just by the names we're saying because if we know that my name there most likely unhappy well and and the backups later story yeah says that Big Mama was the first humpback whale to be spotted in the Strait of Juan de Fuca in nearly a hundred years yeah and I saw her two times dude they were pumps like the deckhands and they were like some one of them works with a like a humpback whale project up there that is and he was like dude you gotta send me that like he was excited so I decided and I love that energy when everybody's excited you get excited then they see the deckhands get excited and then everyone you know it on the boats like wow and what's cool is this whale has been seen by a bunch of our friends like Aaron Kerry Dunbar Sarah and I'm really yeah where'd she see that um not sure I have to go through all the sightings yeah that's already cool yeah what about look up Heather and wrap look up Heather and Raptor the names Heather and no just look up Heather yeah Heather and Raptor hang out together every single year oh wow yeah they're all Pacific Northwest nothing else this is fun it's like stalking whales all right you guys well definitely check out happy well and search those names any of the names you hear it's cuz hear from us or if you have photos you have you want to submit anyone can submit to the database which is really neat yeah it's really fun it's like Pokemon but real look at Eric's because Eric is does it all the time consistently ler yeah so he has ones that go everywhere like all the way down to Mexico probably SM and Y Seminole I need to update my uh my chunky siding cuz I'm calling that wale chunky officially going yet happy way later no you did not I texted Kate and said it's name chunky I wanna call it bill alright you guys well thank you so much for listening to this podcast I hope you enjoyed hearing everything that we saw this week and make sure you guys follow us on Instagram it's wale nerds yeah and you know what we heard from Robbie one of our patreon followers he's headed out for his internship in Portugal so good luck you see lots of cool stuff and thanks for inspiring us to keep doing what we're doing cuz he's been listening to what we've been recommending and he landed a really cool internship so excited for him yeah and once again guys yeah thanks for listening and also we're getting a lot of

hello everyone and welcome back to the well nerds podcast this is episode number 30 Wow my name is Slater and I'm here with Eric and Caitlyn hey guys hello we are on 30 and we're late this is me out already busy lives sorry we work a lot in the summer and I saw a lion king last night Oh review yeah I like that I was really good it's sad I thought it was amazing but I did see a lot of people saying like oh the voice acting was bad but like really yeah and yeah I saw a lot of like negative reviews on the voice acting but I thought it was pretty good who the haters man yeah yeah I've only heard so far personally out of all my friends I've heard one person say anything negative I mean I think the CGI was really good really it looks so real like real lines yeah I thought that works I didn't even know it's so crazy how they can make things look in and out of focus like what it's animated you know mad skills it's 2019 man crazy so yeah what you guys see this week whales well they're they're back in great numbers yeah yeah you guys have a good you had a good trip today Hayek yeah so actually you were oh well you are there not today oh okay I called your captain though during your trip and that's right what so we took two boats out there today everyone and we would actually went outside the Monterey Bay and headed south towards the Cypress Point area our second boat went even further almost a little past Point Lobos and they encountered about about four or more blue whales but between literally between point P notes and point lobos we all easily saw approximately 30 to 35 humpback whales good numbers lunch feeding or this last trip I just literally just came back from we had lunch feeding and we had a whale breach Wow I lost track multiple times so good times out there and even in debate there's plenty of whales so it seems like everything just kind of real summer yeah and that little gap that Caitlin says always happens during June but yeah things are great out there whales back in double-digit numbers I think what else any other we've got those Whitesides in northern right role of dolphin action I'm I had him on almost every trip I went on last week mm-hmm which was good it was funny what day was Friday our middle trip at 1:30 we had two humpback whales lunge feeding pretty consistently with like 40 sea lions but then Whitesides in northern right whale dolphins kept going in and out of it the whole time which was really cool things are looking good yeah there's curl out there too which is bringing some of their bigger wheels blue whales and I think Slater also had a blue whale yesterday I saw a blue whale yesterday you did yeah I made a joke because one of our captains likes to always run south he likes to explore and we said it finally paid off yeah how many times have we gone sound didn't see nothing we always see whales but you know sometimes like we can always just go right to humpbacks but he likes to explore first which isn't a bad thing because you never know what's gonna pop up in Monterey sure he thought there might be blue whales down south and he went and we found him so fishing boats have been saying since like Wednesday that they've been seeing him but way way too far to get you on the well yeah that seems slowly been creeping up that's where we got the tips this morning in fact on the way back they gave me an update said there's some fin whales out there too so yeah it's looking good out there whoa hopefully there tomorrow and in like a closer area yeah the current kind of has slowly been pushing north so I think they'll be around yeah they were off Point Lobos that first day I saw him and so and we were like with him through my house I can let me drown so hopefully they'll still be there when we get there yeah okay I guess what some of the Moss Landing boats all yesterday leatherback sea turtle yeah yeah I think I saw one that's it I'm telling great I want to go on the boat there Tim yeah I know I haven't been out with Kato I only got two if she can find me a turtle tomorrow afternoon I mean come join us okay are you working tomorrow there yeah yeah yeah yeah oh sure you guys are share custody of me yeah later wasn't in the know that yeah you got that weekend mom and I'll be with me weekend mom tomorrow yeah but I thought I thought it was Thursday for some reason but it normally is no really yeah he's getting borrowed tomorrow okay nice are you working tomorrow then I'm I'm off but I have to help send out the trips in the morning so so I'm saying in that noon if you can find me a turtle so get out here people it's great here in the bay it's it's obviously plenty of humpbacks our big wheels are showing up a lot of curl out there turtles are out and looks like a lot of our our buddies out there doing white chart trips right now it's a thing now you know the rescheduled trip yep yeah definitely uh action-packed in Monterey Bay but it sounds like like other places around that summer well watching you're doing pretty good too like out of New England they've had really good humpback action and one of our Instagram followers sent me a sent us the Whale nerds Instagram a message about this kid was fishing out of Cape Cod and this white shark almost jumped in the boat oh geez funny story I know the woman that filmed it uh-huh yeah so she's like posted about it the day it happened they were just fishing in this white shark was trying to catch up to the fish he was reeling in and like leapt at the line and it basically just makes turn in the boat was it the big fish like I don't think it was a cod or something it wasn't very big it's a shark big it so yeah the shark was big really yeah that's where do you think a shark that big would want something like a pinniped I don't know but it was pretty interesting the lady I know yeah I'm not yeah yeah thanks for sending that along there's been quite a couple of shark sightings out of Cape Cod this summer mm-hmm so that's good including here - yeah it's been in Sandy and I love white sharks that have been out here and it's someone even caught a video of a mako actually going after sea lion out here - recently yeah well the bay usually you know people always expect it to be the white sharks going after the pinnipeds but a lot have a lot of studies have been showing that Makos are going after our pinnipeds in fact yeah The Insider being from Southern California there's a lot of people down there have been witnessing it too in fact the rookeries over there in Channel Islands there's often mako sharks like almost like right in the surf lines some of those rookeries picking these animals off if you're a mako shark wasn't that be where you would want to be yeah yeah I would hang out there it's like at the buffet line it's pretty good yeah it's beautiful it's pretty there's lots of food why wouldn't you go and sometimes ultra super rare transient orcas show up there when Adams around speaking of the San Juan Islands I don't sounds like he's having some good chips actually everybody sounds like they're having good trips up there huh yeah yeah yeah there they said usually they have a like one dry spell every summer and it was like the day we left for like four days and no killer whales really and I know I think they've had the t65 A's and the seventy sevens have been back like every day I think awesome very cool dude are you stoked for your trip in September what yeah I'm excited you only have like three seats left yeah Wow that's awesome three seats good it's like really pretty there in this vault is yeah September is really nice time to be in the Pacific they're really everywhere right pretty like leaves actually change colors there okay yeah it's like a real proper fall but I think the Sun set and stuff is just like really it is really mild weather it's warm it's you have later more photography fall tree class potentially there's a lot of evergreen trees there's no sorry but this trip is like quickly with there won't even be time for that it's like morning tonight well watch everyday puddle to the metal dude well that's a good thing about that area the backdrops nice too sir your folks are gonna get good whales with nice backdrops you know the lighting is crazy there yeah your son said although photos are nuts you look oh the water is green someone fix that Franken but that's crank 10 maybe better follow it won't be so green no not there here oh here no I don't want to fix it right now I want more whales I need more green water yeah yeah and while pooping Wales - I'll give up eating I'll get five hunters and wear that like Newport Beach we can have some of their water there's no baby we know it's been I think it's a negotiation Odile I think it's been like dolphins and then dolphins dolphins and then Nicky's following the boat yeah and he will and then our common zones like I've been seeing a lot of post about them asking if the humpback there will come around we stole them all sorry about it really I've been happy when like a few a few a few times lately yeah oh yeah we were looking at all the stuff on the map oh yeah I got a lot of places to go you guys Costa Rica yeah cuz Idaho Qaeda I showed him this one to her company that I follow it's like sure otoko yeah yeah and they've been they saw the white why would again yeah they don't I don't think it's iceberg though to dislike a female I think well there's been two seen yeah we're actually able to get close to it to something um briefly they had a pretty good photo of it like they've gotten close to it but they didn't really give much of a description on their Facebook page they just said like we went out on this trip and saw this then the second trip we saw the white whale there's just what was this yeah wonder how often they see the sperm whale is there like I don't know it's like every few months I would notice it in their posts because I follow one of the companies on Facebook and they'll be fun to go whale watching in Japan yeah especially where if you look at that place like where's that it's really pretty yeah pretty sure you could swim with the whales there too something like that 60 bags Wow yeah well I think that's what it was I'm pretty sure was pretty anything about Japan you got one part of it that's like super cold water then another part that's literally like tropical yeah that's what we're looking at very warm there am emo an emo something like that I think yeah that's where they could swim with the humpbacks I don't think it's the same island that that company goes out of no that's where it's at it was yeah I don't know actually was downs house I think it was it was further down south on Japan yeah and I want to go above there to the what is it Sakhalin Island oh yeah dang dude I'm scared too I saw but I guess it can be done to get a visa yeah you have to get a visa to go to Russia yeah even if you're just like going for a day it's a very extensive background check - nowadays yeah oh really oh there no no but I've heard insider information that there's a lot of killer whales there if you can like get in the country and get on tours well yeah Chris Burkard just went there to shoot photos of on the Stockland islands and they have killer whales mm-hmm they're great whales that go over there - oh that's right that's the probably usually yeah true eastern western western population you soon wes is difficult this time of day well since I said oh so that there's that well trans-pacific it's got the name its trans-pacific is unhappy whale mhm and it's the furthest between distances oh that's right yeah it's funny because if he's where it's been seen both times was one in Costa Rica and one in Tonga so if it's calculated distance between those sightings it's really hard but it's probably not really well still really far down taint articles well because it that means it went to two different breeding grounds mm-hmm yeah like it went down one side one year and then went back up the other side like following the continents on the I wonder what's on the sides of the ocean and it seems like he's been to Costa Rica one a few times actually sees it seems like it's been seen like the last few years have either of you entered any of your happy well stuff lately no I did anything interesting I got one that's pretty cool what there's just one well it's not that it's never been seen but I saw it literally just two or three days ago and hasn't been photo ID'd since 2013 Wow cool yeah it's just the CRC number yeah I took the connections it's only me and someone down in Cabo yeah that's I was wondering if you're always with me so I'm wondering if you it showed up on yours I do have a couple flukes from like yesterday and day before that I haven't put on yeah um I had a group of kids that came up with a name for chunkies mom what they want to name it big so when you see the pair it's big and chunky okay kids come up with the best names I wonder if there's a real name big on there well there's Big Momma yeah they want no they just wanted big so I was also named one like cookies and foods like notorious b.i.g will name her they know gee I guess I whales been breaching it's funny cuz the first of all days I thought everybody was like oh that no one's seen a preacher anything yet and now I guess it's been going wild almost like two days in a row I heard I haven't seen the baby breech but the mom I've seen breech and then Kate coming sent me a picture of it breaching to ya know they had the baby reow they did well we we were with the blue whale mhm down south yesterday the whole time on the radio oh another tail throw another breeze oh really yeah well if Luke's really good already for how small it is like all of us have fluke photos of it now yeah as it actually soaks every time yeah yeah every time it's really funny that's awesome I feel like they could fluke right away though it's just very weird when they first do it because I saw those little babies in Hawaii fluke yeah a fluke but it just like flops around like flicks its tail I don't think they control anything weather like that was a notorious for that like especially great whales you always get ones that fluke and then they come back up in a click again okay yes yeah you really psyched me out boys they're like oh they can like gray whales can't fluke when they're close to shore okay yes they can missed again I've seen them they're like oh another hit their head on the bottom like no they fluke when they want like they can fluke and not dive how many times you see them fluke and they say like just three people that actually brings up a good thing you guys should explain to people why exactly Wells fluke and why they don't fluke I'll tell you why science I'm ready hit me with it okay so that they can get it makes it easier for the dive there you go exactly so books this naturalist that used to work in Monterey that I did like a offshore survey with Katherine she actually says it pretty funny she's like so humpbacks are pretty wide for how long they are they're kind of like me we're not going anywhere fast she so that's why they need to put their tail up because they need some help to go down yeah so basically get all your yeah all your body weight behind you point your head straight down and easy done and yeah kind of like a free diver same concept exactly buddy yeah yeah and that's why Hana shallow that sometimes you don't fluke yeah yeah but it still can if they want to know exactly exactly our wells are more agile than you think out here I say watch one yesterday like spin really quickly mm-hmm like I was like wait wasn't it just going the other way yeah I love that about our it's like the big whales too like yeah that's huge 50-foot humpback it's literally like coming at you it's ten feet away and then we think it bends in yeah it's like how'd you do that just turned on a dime yeah that's pretty cool they're super edgy Lee dude I saw this weird thing two whales were mostly feeding together as a pair and you know how they come up like one after another in echelon formation so it's like one whale surfaces and then immediately behind it is the second whale they're parallel to each other but one point the whales surfaced head-on like parallel to each other they like me went and passed each other opposite head to tail it was so weird we had air can I yesterday Jenner yeah I had two humpbacks of lunch feed towards each other side lunge oh yeah yeah I had yeah that's basically what it was they could make a little more sub surface though one one was way up he lunged and the other one like did it right under the water but they were both going yeah hop dance later seen some pretty like close calls we've seen this other one it's almost well this is kind of a subject you know thresher sharks yeah a lot of people think they just whip their tails yeah hit the fish but what they do is they they're smart they use momentum they actually swim really fast at their target yeah and early move their neck turn your PEC fins position to do like larly like brakes yeah it flicks that tail over when we saw insider saw how that dude is something similar yeah I was like literally heading towards as well and all Sun you just see it like hit the brake somehow it's like I think it repositioned to the PEC span or something but like a parachute like I want to stop I'm going too fast hey any of you guys you guys probably both heard me mention on the boat if you looked up the tubercle effect how engineers look at humpback whales yeah planes yeah just try to design an airplane okay you guys imagine if you get on your plane and it has Buffalo in your leg okay we're going down like are you telling me really that that's faster and safer if you guys don't know what it is look it up it's really interesting that so the tubercles of a humpback whale we always knew their hair follicles but engineers are looking at whales and they're thinking they're the pumps are actually breaking up the turbulence and even you'll notice that the edge of their PEC fins the leading edge also have bumps so they're not smooth so everyone's thinking that this actually makes you more hydrodynamic maybe that's why our humpbacks can be so agile and turned on a dime and all that good stuff that combined with the fact that they have such long PEC fins yeah yeah if they do add it to the plane they better paint the plane like a whale dude go be awesome I'm buying a plane yeah seriously did you see that that that water when you come water planes seaplane seaplane so we're in the San Juans it's painted like a Orca no idea yeah you know I'm like online or something I should do that as he plays fun there was like a you know what Southwest decades ago SeaWorld was like did a cross-promotion and they were I think that where planes painting like there's their commercials I'm playing that so in flight that's like a beluga whale or something really yeah oh you guys Margaret and I were driving back from olenka yesterday and on the beach they were flying kites and one was a huge whale shark Oh cold or jealous like yeah jellyfish kite would be awesome I'm talking like like a real swell shark really pretty big I mean they were like it was like 20 feet it seemed I need to go fly a kite we saw from the freeway problem I give us pretty big right down to sand dunes wherever those that we're dividing syntax okay cool that's hopefully they're out there again I want to see that I want to go like attack a Margo and the paragliding company I said let's do this and they wrote tomorrow and they said we trade us eyelashes fur yeah so we haven't talked to them but I really really want to do that one that'd be cool yes good I want to do it on a day where there's like humpbacks came out of their lunch meeting in the beach oh that would be kind of I could see them from there that's very true you're not you're not going out over the ocean really but you can still see them you can see them from the road exactly that's like even further back they seem like Pete may have had some lunch meeting yeah I saw Pete's photo the dunes in the background the other night yeah that was the five o'clock trip I think yesterday or two days ago that's not my favorite is when they're doing that I think it's funny when you see people in the background at the Fed mm-hmm it's neat it's a good perspective yes yeah because like you normally it's like okay like you see that with great whales people in the background but it's kind of cool to see humpbacks feeding in the beach yeah it's kind of like our old pics back in Laguna yeah you always have people in the background but what's neat is this yeah here you got people don't realize that's that's highway one right there PCH just riding the other side of those dunes right there I'd say highway one on PCH cuz Central California says PCH real really real adults in certain California say that cool people hipsters hipsters you say okay that is realize you guys we're on episode 30 what are you gonna talk about this or what dude where's Ben well laws like an anus I'd like to thank the Academy how about the killer whales we haven't seen any killer whales for how long I hate us taking summer vacay I think it sent Ben since like somewhere in the June a month ago exactly like a month like June 20th if you like but we had him here for like six days yeah so they do pretty shortly I feel like it was that first week of June it was literally like what two weeks straight of yeah pretty proud we're due for some we take your summer vacation dude someone wrote me this morning they said hey I'm going well I'm in Monterey today where can i see orcas my last my last sighting was June 21st is that I think that was lasting I think that was the day you called me when I got out diving and then you're like get over here it was an afternoon yeah we all was a baby-making day yeah we all went out together that might have been the last day or maybe one or two days after that yeah went out the same trip before yeah remember you called me after okay I got the water - yeah do we have killer rows Wow yeah member they were mating mystery pod oh I did my vlog that day yeah I got to do a vlog Andy's I'm grounded hey so I have a question from one of our listeners go for it um so we've kind of answered this like throughout different podcasts but not specifically so I this person says I was curious about dolphins breeding feeding and social behavior in Monterey Bay especially northern right well dolphins wow I don't think I've ever seen the Maine well that's the thing there's not much out there about them right yeah yeah so I think if you looked at like the 30 year history you would see on cold phase years the northern right whale dolphins are in view from whale watch boats and Monterey Bay pretty often in the spring and summer same thing with specific white side of dolphins Rizzo's I feel like there's some component of them that are here all the time yeah yeah um especially if are turning out here in water temp and it's with availability yeah but then on warmer phase years you're not really gonna see white sides or northern right whale dolphins but you will see common dolphins exactly that's a weird that you say warmer like we see white side in new oh yeah they come to Newport though in the winter but it's never that that's like never evidence never as cold as it some say yeah some say that the ones that we're seeing in Southern California later might be more of a baja population coming up towards to us yeah really yeah because I feel like it's a dip it's got to be a different group in white size than what we see and that's very true because that's like 12 it's never when have you ever seen honey more than 2 1 exactly literally more than done I've never seen more than 25 and we don't see him do those back flips like coastal more for population or something that's another thing about this question is for example Rizzo's you know for example that scars movie I was watching all that information is just about that population off the azureus you know who knows if our Rizzo's here had the exact same dynamics in their social structure like that I honestly think there's some sort of coastal group that's here all the time and I'm sure then there's an offshore group that comes in when there's a lot of food could be no meat up to a bit yeah they definitely know when more breeding happens to like my all day trip that I had in May yeah there was literally unlimited white-sided thousands the whole day you said like a couple thousand if you can't get a good shot and the Brownells showed up for yeah like there were so many that there was more than one Brownells there was three that's an example of like how like you may see groups of Whitesides every day but then like you only see the Brownells once every few months yeah so that hurt that particular heard only comes through every few months or something yeah like it's different dolphins every day yeah do you think that now probably not possible like because you know they they don't get what they don't get why tides in like this hanwen island COC area what they do up in British Columbia and then or that I can the northern part I think and I wonder if those ones go straight out to the ocean and come down probably maybe it's pretty far right but they cover so much area it definitely could you know like the ones we see in Monterey me yeah probably not oh no I don't know board that's exceed sx-70 pretty far yeah yeah it's still like what do you think about other species of dolphins like spinner dolphins they track them over these huge areas of the ocean looking for Lantern Orca or technically you know killer whales go up there what we see them is 4,000 miles 3,000 miles apart from there you know last sighting so yeah you never know yeah actually if you think about it and there's probably it's much easy for a killer whale to get well not all killer whales but like transients to get food than it is you know for white sides right I mean there's sea lions everywhere up and down the coast there's small fish everywhere too so ya never know yeah but that's what I'm saying so if well know there's this the fish is probably more scarce in like the sea land yeah I would say so yeah because I'm saying that would make them travel further but they also mm-hmm yeah they could also be just like following currents and stuff to wherever the food is cuz they're they can be generalist too they can eat squid or fish but you guys say that our white sites could potentially go across the Japan are no other I would opens or no no if they to go that far because the dolls porpoise they have the truly farm and the dolly form okay so they see the truly form only on the western part of the Pacific around Japan yeah but they see truly and Dali over there yeah but we never see the true reform here I don't know what that means so there's like this like a Brownells but it's yeah but they only see that odd morph over on the other side so that must mean there's not a whole lot of overlap I think well if they do go offshore how far offshore do those doing the Rambo dolphins go dude well we saw him let me know why it's pretty far offshore well I'm thinking about that Cal coffee cruise I did a few years ago I think we saw northern right well dolphins like over a hundred miles offshore but we also saw humpback whales like 300 what yeah mom and a calf to you do you think there's food up there too oh for sure yeah random right it's probably not like just like yeah yeah it's more patchy that year we went though was the year that the Vil Ella's were everywhere and we saw the whole time carpets and vilela it's like huge patches it was so cool the board trip 2020 but let's do it off of all to answer the question basically yeah I don't I can't name of a single report on or paper about just particular types of dolphins in the Monterey Bay ya know I know a few people are trying to work on the Rizzo's thing like two or three different projects going on and then like the coastal bottlenose has been studied really well since they started expanding into new habitats so that can kind of lend you some hints as to what may be going on with other species but the northern right whale dolphins especially are not well studied because they're usually so remote yeah but I do know there's papers on other populations of of dolphins out there like I always talk about then what those reserves neosaurus by yeah and there I'll look up the name in a second but yeah there's a woman who's done some major studies over there in the Azores and we really don't know that that information can be transferred to other populations yeah also this is my general rule of thumb with dolphins so when food is highly abundant you're more likely to see multiple social groups come together and that's when you're more likely to see breeding would you agree Eric I think so yeah cuz like with killer whales like when you have a huge gray whale season sometimes you get groups of 35 to 40 and make sex better genetic diversity yeah and then you know wow look at all these uh ladies and gentlemen we haven't seen for a while I'm gonna hook up with somebody yeah I hope the great whales are doing good I hope they rally I hope they're feeding good this summer we'll see it may be I mean based on that last big El Nino die-off it may be another bad northbound season next year before things turn around I'm not yeah yeah I think it was two or three little die offs not just the one big one during the late 90s El Nino so pretty scary we'll see do you want some other sad news or no sad news right there's two more dead North Atlantic right whales yeah and there's three active entanglements that they're tracking and trying to disentangle really yeah do they say they put like satellite markers on them like yeah and they fly they allocate a lot of money to like fly every day to try and relocate them every day oh planes yeah dang yeah well they're so endangered that it's like they really have to try and do it yeah are they more endangered than this or the residents um well the southern residence is one population of killer whales where's the North Atlantic right whales that's all that's left in the whole ocean and also if you think about it at the southern residents although they're at lower numbers the numbers were never like crazy high right there by yeah yes so yeah like there was a lot more northern right whale dolphins at one point in time right whales are we still just under 500 no its 411 for that Oh 411 now yeah well now it's like 409 jeez it was it was 411 before breeding season this year they had seven births I think geez and then they've had eight deaths so now they're operating in the negative again how long's their just gestation period twelve months just like other large baleen whales okay yeah they breed off of like Florida Georgia the Carolinas Eric didn't catch that one I didn't get I don't know she's in Florida Georgia and I said line musical group yes the problem is with them is there's this 18 right month gestation period yeah yeah and then the survivorship of the calf's is pretty low yeah it's like 50% and even it's it's always not it's not always that I either even beyond what's going on right or is it survivorship normally well the survivorship probably was higher before the waters were so polluted mm-hmm like before humans really heavily settled the coastlines around there range because right now what they're dealing with like even even now some of those females are still offloading DDT from their own body through the milk into the calf like they've built up all these chemicals from living in such a coastal environment this is offloads through the milk into the cast yeah so first your mothers they say is usually the calf doesn't survive and it's because it's her first time pushing all of our toxins out yeah the second time usually the calf survived yeah cuz the build up time is less between the first and second kaftan the first calf cuz she's had like you know potentially 1012 years of buildup and then the next time around it's only like two years to think they don't think about that part yeah yeah especially that poor first calf but then as as your genetic pool gets smaller cuz your population gets smaller I don't know how that affects calf survivorship you know what are your odds of birth defects and things like that does that really start to go up mm-hmm so I read a paper because we talked about the whole j1 ruffles has actually ended up becoming being an l-pod oh yeah I think his mother was actually like l 41 or something I forget the name I forget the number but I wonder how many of them are cataloged as like JKL and are actually not JKL you know what I mean yeah and talk to backtrack on those because maybe they are 30 years old or something and they didn't you know catch it then yeah it's hard to back track that stuff unfortunately yeah yeah so now they can just go off what the hair has to be I'm sure there's more mistakes in there no we don't know about so then that brings up the thought of adoption amongst pods right so like say the parents are l-pod and then the whale ends up in j-pod like Onix yeah and I think that's that's exactly what happened he he I think it's Onix the lost his mom and then he went to j-pod and probably was just like adopted by someone else yeah didn't you say you had a paper about that Eric adoption um that was an ER species but interspecies yeah I had a just there's a paper on Mar man that just came out a few days ago about Bono's adopting um melon-headed whales was it adopting or was it stealing it was actually that's what I heard I heard about the I told you guys about the common dolphin with the partners they said that it's like a captive thing like they hold it for ransom people use the word steal before I read the paper I'm forgetting two details I read I was trying to you know read some many papers I could but it did say something that that it seems like what there's really persistent cabs out there I guess the melon-headed kept on trying to approach this following those and tried to nurse on it over and over again Oh ruling they're saying Anna that that persistency you know probably caused the and the maternal instincts of a female okay fine hmm yeah because Bono knows also have a lot of hybrids yeah like I feel like they hybridize with every dolphin known to this planet yeah guys common dolphins down to you there they're pretty freaky out there yeah and we have have seen like a lot of you know animals out there you guys saw that one on Kate's boat yeah right well dolphin and maybe was it but it had it but it had dorsal fin right yeah and a common dolphin beat Kye never sent there no well someone suggested that but I really thought it was a white side and northern right whale dolphin hybrid so much you got to think someone someone went weird yeah exactly yeah these pots are so huge and you know sometimes I'm sure there's hybrids that blow right by us and we're not seeing them oh for sure you know so with all those sightings that we had of the northern right well so far this year how many of those were with white sides all the time every time I've seen but there has been like a few but I guarantee you white sides were so nearby even that day we had like thousands of them yeah yeah you still see a pop up I wonder if it's like they need white sighs they honestly need your dorsal fin we need your your your confidence booster cuz like white sides are really curious about everything right like when I used to film with the tow camera behind the boat the white sides would be mugging it so hard cuz you're like what is this thing but the only time I would get a northern right whale dolphin in the shot a white side was with it like they would not approach the camera but it might be a hunting strategy to I think you know maybe one animals better at something and the others taking advantage it's true colors our sea lion and yeah yeah they're like a parasite basically stop following me you imagine the white side the whole time stop following me yeah oh so you know the one paper just the back track it's a tiny bit again asking about this doesn't have to do up any Monterey Bay dolphins but there's a great papers out there on Rizzo dolphin ecology by a woman by the name of Karen Louise Hartman that's the person who that's cars documentaries based on yeah so look up any of her papers and they're just amazing good facts about these animals just basic biology and also social structures we have yet to know if they're social structures apply to Rizzo's worldwide but it's so interesting read so look up any paper by her once again Karen Louise Hartman and it spelled ka RI and epic Karen I am the i n Karen Karen so you guys this week we are all gonna watch long gone wild together you're making us a movie date yeah do you know exactly what it's about did you go watch the trailer earlier and it sounds like it's a bit more in-depth about how the whole captive industry works as far as like how much you auction a whale for and like what markets they're coming from really from what I heard from some friends that came on the boat the other day that it's basically where black fish left like yeah and it's more like looking at the buy/sell part of it at the beginning from capture to selling it to an aquarium or dolphinarium mm-hmm and then there's a little bit of talk about like whale sanctuaries as well possibly it wasn't really played up too heavily in the trailer but it's an hour in 23 minutes so it seems like it's gonna give you a pretty in-depth view of like more of the logistics of how the industry actually works guess what I'm doing tonight what watching without us I want you here I'm gonna watch around myself tonight to that but I do I don't want you over yes okay we'll do it we'll have to do a group watching sorry I have plans aren't we your friends you are my friends so spending time with you now yeah I've just spent time with my other friends okay so we'll have to do it like a reaction for episode 31 or something it's on Amazon and video I'm gonna buy it tonight okay go buy another TV so we'll give our about this later can't watch it we'll watch it and then we'll do a review for episode 31 yeah yeah okay okay cool um did you want your shot at redemption for your ocean here else later you guys got text me about these things I'm sorry okay we'll leave it for next time maybe are you ready no I'm not ready okay well you guys I think we'll end it here yeah I was gonna say I think I'm out of topics thanks for sending those by the way Instagram peeps and I forgot to tell you you Eric I told Slater we had a superfan come on the boat oh yeah on Friday his name's Bennett and he's ten I got one yeah it is okay before we get you if you tried to clear was looking for you too and then later in the week he went out with discovery so they kept on missing me oh he loves whales dude he was so cool he liked who was asking all kinds of questions and he was just like having the best time that's his whole family came it was really fun yeah sorry mr. Bennett but yeah my crews both my crew Zi told me that you were wanting to meet me in Slater but and I totally messed up and like we should have taken a selfie or something and we didn't my bad yeah we kept that where I just happen to be on opposite boats a day but you were on the right boats but not the right day but yeah yeah but thanks for trying to thanks for stopping by anyway yeah we'll meet we'll catch up with you oh they're so they drove like 12 hours or something to get to monitor so they can come again now but essentially I I'm sure they well cuz I guess Bennett's like super into everything well really cool when you get to episode 30 Bennett I know you're behind you'll you'll hear our little shout out it was really fun well yeah thanks Bennet we'll try - I'll catch up with you one day yeah yeah thank you guys so much for listening to all of our podcasts I can't believe we're at 30 if you don't follow us on Instagram it's wale nerds and we're on Spotify iPod being iTunes so you can listen to us anywhere now yeah I don't know where else but I'm sure there's somewhere else with YouTube somewhere you will play YouTube yeah and thanks to all the listeners on there's average like I don't know a couple interviews on every one of those what sites so it's pretty cool yeah yeah it's amazing I'm yeah we're meeting a lot of listeners too it's kind of amazing yeah this is this was just for fun and so many people are dedicate to listening to us every week oh I know something cool if you guys have anyone you think we should invite to be on the podcast oh yeah cuz we haven't had a new one on the podcast in a while we've been talking about it and then we haven't done it so if you guys have any suggestions yeah that'd be pretty cool yeah let us know yep latest no I think I'll end it here thank you thanks for listening everyone thank you

-

hello everyone and welcome back to the well Nerds podcast this is episode number 31 and my name is Slater and I'm here with Eric and Caitlyn hello everyone hello and we are ready we're ready for what from casting whale stuff okay well we watched that movie oh yeah what was it called long gone wild on gone wild you want to talk about that first it was sad it was kind of sad yeah why is everything well related sad dude cuz we messed up the ocean humans can't help themselves man they don't know how else to be it was the pressing yet informative yeah it kind of it was like the next step after blackfish so like you learn more death because I feel like getting over a lot of the same stuff learn more about how they're acquiring the whales and what's their cost and it's a worldwide problem yeah I should shed it more light on the industry outside the United States because there are and on it yeah yeah that too because there's captive whales in Europe and Asia in addition to North America and I don't know how you would count the Canary Islands technically Europe because their territory of Spain but it's off the coast of Africa but there's a lot more to it than I think most people realize and so it was it was definitely interesting to watch and the money into it was kind of scary to what was that figure about the Russian guys making what 7 million oh yeah 1 to 7 million I don't know if that's what the guys that are catching them are making but that's what they auctioned for like that's what the facility would pay for the animal that's scary yeah how much of those belugas we're going for something about that in there they didn't say it in the thing but yeah it's not also not just killer whales its beluga whales too and pilot whales and what else all kinds of different types of dolphins you know it's pretty interesting if you guys want to watch this yourself what did we find it was five bucks yeah I think we rented it for $5.99 or something on Amazon order for 48 hours yeah and there are some people that in the US are pretty well known like Nami rose and Ric O'Barry and then there was some other and more international folks as well that were talking about different perspectives of the industry from around the world there's some former SeaWorld trainers on it so it's pretty interesting to hear actually it was interesting to hear people talk about Keiko again too because some people kind of called his C pen thing a total failure but they you know they're of the frame of mind that for the last few years of his life even if there wasn't that many left he got to be live free you know I lived there for five years I think yeah so five years is pretty long right I mean I think any amount of time where you get to not be in a concrete pen would be nice if it's only a few months I think being comfortable for the rest of your days is a good way to go and he died of something that could have happened inside a tank as well for sure Tilikum died to the same thing in a tank pneumonia yeah and we also and they also touched on well sanctuaries they're trying to put sanctuary on where they're doing one off of the East Coast in Canada they have sites they're looking at in Nova Scotia yeah I think so yeah did they also have and they are way or something that a European site yeah exactly what a nice end right now for the Blue Goose oh okay I'm not it's not the same people I don't think but they do have sanctuary a nice and for the blue grouse which I haven't seen anything on that since in really how do you guys feel about that idea of them being in like a Cove where you can kind of go and see them from like a darker I mean I think if if it's all you know taken under a huge amount of consideration and it's really carefully with the animals best interests in mind I think you could do it in a way that's definitely gonna be right for the whale I'm just afraid of someone saying oh okay we'll put them someone bigger you know give them more room but we're still gonna make money off of it because now people have to pay to see him in these sanctuaries now I think they're gonna have to make money off it no matter what but that's truly how they get funded I wouldn't be in favor of it perpetuating a captive industry but I would be in favor of them making money to maintain the facility out of here at a high quality so that the whales get to live out the rest of their days you know under the best possible care and then when they're gone they're gone like more of it you know when you go to a state park it's like well there's a fee yeah so kind of like that like it's a donation yeah Parker yeah so yeah maybe you can make it it maybe they just have to donate ten dollars or more people can donate whatever want because they have to feed the animal and they yeah and they're still gonna have to do husbandry and medical checks a paper staff yeah yeah um I wonder if the office do things like you know make it breach and stuff like that just so that it's active or do you think it'll be active enough no I think one round yeah I think that if you give them viewing platforms and just tell them it's the whales are not doing behaviors that we ask them when you're here you're just the luck of the draw I mean that's the same thing as trying to watch whales from shore and you pay to get into a state park you know I think it'd be cool to let them do their natural thing and not do that yeah the only time they should be asking the trainers should be asking the animal for behaviors is to do you know health care stuff yeah that's my thought on it you know there's no more performances yeah just let them let them be and let them relax and retire the rest of their days yeah that's a pretty interesting it's they talked about that whole blackfish effect - mm-hmm changed everyone in the industry obviously oh you know it was cool that they talked about was that when they wait when they were watching keko keko how do you say when they were watching Keiko they said that he was headed towards a pot of killer other killer whales oh yeah stop and the other like pod had branched off into like three sections one head-on and two from the side and then they never got close I think happy way that's kind of sad they didn't they had the hydrophone towing during the whole encounter and they didn't detect any sounds from any other we always like friends but it's also to point out it's like a very military approach tactic like they're flipping smart yeah yeah Mary and I talked about the number oh yeah the number of animals per country and that's kind of a scary thing I didn't realize there was so many whales still left at San Diego there's ten whales yeah it was that many I think the total was what 20 TC world's combined I think 18 or 20 yes in the u.s. sea world's industry so the sea world is there anything what else is there in marine parks oh the Seaquarium as a separate got one okay then there's the Mirage in Vegas but they just have bottlenose dolphin yeah the thing they showed at the end was only killer whales I mean that doesn't even count all the facilities that have done all those ones that were that were in China and they're like malls were still China only had ten yeah we had the same amount of them she was at 15 oh I thought that was that was no I thought that was like dolphinariums as we couldn't bleed out anywhere oh yeah that was just really well how many marine parks and most of those in China are wild-caught Russian killer whales is the impression I'm under after watching the film it seems like yeah Russia's catch the catching and most of the ones that are still being sold today like around this sea of our stock and the Sakhalin Islands is where they actually have pretty big populations of killer whales and I don't think I've I've hardly ever seen any research come out of there so I don't even know if people fully understand what kind of whales they have some of the research that has come out of there unfortunately has been from the the captive animals like how we found out the ena hemispherical you know yeah but as far as like cetacean surveys from that area the only thing I've seen is for the East the western Pacific gray whales yes only an occasional bowhead whale and right well information but I've not really seen any odana see information and they're really pretty I know I know some Russians independently not like probably what the country is bidding were also trying to figure out some of the later records of whaling I didn't know but the Russians actually took whales just almost like just ninety its closes ninety miles off the u.s. u.s. coastline it's very there's all those Soviet whaling launcher surfaced way after the USSR was disbanded that they were hunting whales long after they had said they weren't yeah I mean hundreds of thousands more whales I think yeah there's a good old paper with Marmont that talked about that it's pretty interesting there's so many whales there were so many whales hmm it blows your mind to think how many did they actually used to be because they're coming back like the hump not all of them but the humpbacks like there must have been so many humpback whales well yeah I mean just this last week where we've been seeing groups of ten to fifteen feeding whales and you see more than one group that size around you okay you're not that far from shore literally bill called out on the radio so I got like three or whatever and then another boat called they're like we're like we see about seven and they were on the way to that one so that means there was at least ten right there and then we hadn't easily ten like no problem we saw more than fifteen more than fifteen well my tips yesterday we came upon a feeding pot of twelve and then took off and then came upon about another you know twelve we watched today was like seven or eight when we first got there may be as many as 15 in the middle of it all and whales were just coming in and out of it the whole time and if you scan the horizon you could easily have counted another ten to fifteen whales exactly draw a line from point B Neos to Santa Cruz so basically all the way copy and shut it off how many humpbacks are in the bay right now eighty to ninety yeah I wouldn't doubt close to 100 cuz everybody's been saying in all the war buddies Amasya really happy they haven't had to come towards us Santa Cruz they've been sharing Wales with the northern moss feeding groups yeah so we had easily like 25 in our little quarter a corner here today yeah by the point yeah for sure there's so many Wales where the Dolphins go you guys we had yesterday we had Whiteside it's this was funny they tell you how the white side it's in order right well dolphins and one common thing yeah one common dolphin a colony for one it's what we talked about last time yeah one they hold one captive I think so yes so or has lost its pot or something's in the Santa Barbara Channel two Condor Express said they had like over a thousand just like two days ago yeah for them that's pretty normal but Morro Bay two days ago had common dolphin so maybe they're gonna give us the visits I'll see how far they comments coming don't think you should come here and spring though the winter when the weather's cold the water gets warmer the seasons backwards here science although if the ocean warms up a lot you know no matter what time of year the common dolphins usually are not too far behind someone today on the boat asked me and he said is it usually this overcast here no it's usually foggy and then I said but I will guarantee that there will be Sun around the wharf as soon as it was super blue skies like everywhere except all where all the whales are it's all cloudy and then soon as you get back to the dock it's like your clam chowder bowls and sunshine whales yeah pulls in sunshine Oh so backs are coming back to the movie one of the organizations that they referenced that I want to learn more about is the China cetacean Alliance which looking up their homepage it is a coalition of international animal protection and conservation organizations comprising Animal Welfare Institute Born Free foundation endangered species fund Environment and Animal Society Taiwan Hong Kong dolphin Conservation Society I'm gonna butcher this Kuroshio Ocean Education Foundation life investigation agency marine connection and whale and dolphin Conservation so WDC is a member and it's mostly focused on raising awareness around the captive industry in the ocean theme parks in mainland China because they said that they're actually like expanding right yeah China is like just hitting the beginnings of this captive whale industry is what the film kind of made it sound like they're really trying to expand and open more facilities I mean that one facility hasn't even debuted the six whales they have they're like getting them ready for display now oh yeah they were in like that concrete like building yeah I mean at the end of those six whales breaching in the end of the film like that facility's not even open yet I guess six killer was breaching at the same time so well guess why that's gonna happen for me in the wild one day I bet you could get six spy hops for sure yeah like in Antartica or like Norway yeah sure but I've gotten to breach I've gotten a double breach from a killer whale before me too with calves little babies and a double reach for my humpback using that yes oh speaking of breeches I saw like the best breach the other day and it was perfect timing for me because I stepped out of the bathroom I was closing the door and I turned around and a whale was breaching in my face this flops landed like five feet from the boat that's crazy man we get wet no the splash almost hit the boat though and I was like wow good thing I saw it at least cuz there was no way I was kidding a photo of I haven't I haven't gotten a good humpback regional Wow but we have breeches today I know we've had quite a few great breeches off and on the last like three or four trips I've been out on but it's like one breech and then it's done and you're like alright never getting a photo a few wheels breech today yeah we're all like but there's been lot of lunging yes we did get lunging at the end Jerian yeah yesterday was really good for lunging yeah your photos were awesome yeah it's been the very lungi lungi and got a lot of bait fish coming towards us too let's see there's I've been getting really lucky you know like I feel like our captains are gonna need to have their hearts checked after this last week the whales coming so close to the boat all the time you know what speaking of all the humpbacks back in the area there's a lot of fluke IDs going on yeah I've seen a lot of new whales yes and really cool flukes - yeah a lot of white ones this hour and some interesting couple with a lot of rake marks yeah and so that was one of our questions was could you guys talk about the rake marks that we're talking about yeah but multiple species get rake marks on them hmm would you say I guess all the all this except for like you don't see it on fin whales I guess they've all been raked probably by something yeah I mean I think the blue whales have them on their flutes more than we realize because they don't fluke that often blue eyes do it in rows down yeah and I don't know how well scars show up on their body either you know like humpbacks the scarring usually is pretty obvious especially around the fluke but I don't know how well scars like that show up on other species of whales because most dolphins have rake marks from each other but they're so light once you hear can't bottom as you can see pretty well the officers and they're by riding in a clear blue day when you got them up close to you or you're dealing with stranding you see them completely covered with yeah yeah but like on the big whales the rake marks a lot of times come from killer whales although I've heard some speculation from people that work out of cabo that it could also be sued orca well that and also you've got especially males it's good just be from barnacles for another Mouse yeah especially across the back oh I come back for hump yeah great well I guess yeah yeah do the gray wolves gonna do the same thing yeah I guess they do huh yeah northbound you sometimes see the middle yeah weird facts do but they definitely rub on each other a lot and would scratch each other with barnacles and stuff that's barnacle they're sharp yeah but their skin also just like falls off like it's nothing do you think they feel that when they get cut those things would cut you up oh yeah don't feel it definitely and there's like whatever like you scratch me with your nail kind of thing I guess yeah dang you don't know there's a few whales humpbacks at least well I've seen a few gray whales to where the flukes are pretty well chewed up is today you saw one yesterday yeah we had one with missing half of the left side of the fluke today and it was very chewed up all around the edges of the fluke yeah a lot of ones that are like this figured yeah have been showing up lately got this one yesterday two days ago Flopsy oh yeah I saw her she has a chunk missing just a little tank in the corner it all Batman was here the my boy this guy dance me feed this guy oh what the right side missing and then this one at the right side missing yeah yeah yeah see I see one two three two one no fun name on it but that's the collar we're gonna have to come up with a fun name yeah the one with the right side missing Slater we saw last week it was around for like four days yeah and then yeah and then you saw one with the left side missing yeah there's one with the opposite side missing too so there's a bunch of ones with really obvious you know deformities yeah one summer I documented like six different ones with half a flute oh here we go and this this whale I guess this isn't Batman but it does look like very similar that's thank out yeah that is my picture wow that is a really cool fluke though it's got like some pieces missing in the middle and a big white mark up the right side like a big line wait so you saw Batman or not no fake fake Batman oh here here's this guy Fran and our feeding group for a hot second today Slater yeah been around I think so I thought I saw this Will's been around too oh yeah with the like curled up right side on the corner so you guys are looking at humpbacks and you're not entering for those unhappy well you should it's really fun we also had a whale today which I think Slater did end up getting the fluke of that had a nice propeller scar at the left side yeah for sure got a fluke I think but I don't know net like I don't know which way it was yeah like when I got the fluke of it I'm not positive because it was traveling with one will you guys are all listening going while you're looking all these whales and where can we get this we all submit photos to a happy whale calm we submit the underside for those of the flukes of humpbacks and yeah it will give you an idea who you're looking at and then what's fun is there's a little bio on the whales sometimes and you can actually choose to follow the well and have it sorry spotted you will know who responded and where so it's kind of a fun thing kind of I always call the free souvenir on the boat you got a decent lens ooh that one's later just pulled up happy well completely different because that one has a rake mark yes yes you were looking at earlier I think yeah I don't know but there's so many cool flukes lately if you guys want to come whale watching and and catch pokemon basically yeah yeah it's kind of like that time because you can get so mad actually I'll bet it's later today I was like get the fluke you got to catch them all I seriously was like I think the most fun part from you right now be sake until they start really lunch feeding you know we all bother yeah that's the same whale Eric yes no I saw him Saturday one two three two one lame name bro let me see there's a bio on it what can we name it I don't know no fun by AP you have to think about it crazy scrape and here's one's one thing we can do this whale has been seen all the way down towards Cabo San Lucas oh cool the northern Mexico breeding grounds dad I don't have any whales that have gone very far then I'll go to cabo well I think I mean I don't know hmm is there a way to check like all of my whales I've seen ya log into your thingamajig I'm logged in okay now go up to your whales under your picture your whales showing Slater around a happy well here I have ok to be honest you guys I have more IDs than anyone I have 130 you want if you want to get competitive look at this you guys know it's ridiculous yeah yeah yeah 1400 I came really is a cheater though because she freakin enters that you know she listens to it she's good I'm telling you she's gonna get phony you know what and then Tim Huntington's next when a hack the system and put two two numbers in front of my number here we go here's my I'm number 19 so yeah you're number 64 so the rake marks well I'm a loser so those marks are cause on the humpbacks are mainly are pretty much just cause from either barnacles rubbing from other males and then the ones on their flukes and stuff are caused by killer whales or false killer whales oh they think that they're doing that to them yeah some of the guys that worked on in Cabo think that cedar orca also harassed the humpback they definitely eat dolphins which is crazy yeah did you guys see that they're eating spinner dolphins or something like that yeah it's pretty cool speaking of killer whales those ETP showed up down south again oh yeah yeah isn't that like nothing I could see it someone took a selfie with one that was wake riding their boat it's pretty gnarly a lot of people seems like a lot of boats got to see him though yeah it was good suppose the second day we're worthy though they were uh ago and they couldn't catch them San Onofre Sacramento they went way down Oceanside boat Ghanim that's nice about having fast boats yeah just true you definitely need them down there so you can get two well sightings yeah it sounds like it's been pretty slow until they showed up a couple period of swells and maybe a fin whale or something make you well oh thank you of lots of common dolphins down south yeah common dolphins everyday come on doll for shoes I'll take like a day of common dolls yeah I kind of Miss them should we just go down there and go watch common dolphins for today hopefully they're still there when we get there well they'd be still be there they travel what's the biggest see there are a couple days when we get there all right what's the biggest part of dolphin do you guys think you've seen 2,000 common dog probably acted 3,000 animals yeah feel like Tim what okay I've had days where every magic pencil yeah sure I've seen thousands like two plus I've had days where we'll travel five miles and just you see him just non-stop one time we had like 2,000 in one heard like not spread out just going it was so cool okay the common dolphins though I swear you can get them easily 3,000 like on like a random Meetup like they'll be from Newport to Catalina like there's just dolphins everywhere but how about on my all-day trip with the white side Simon order how many were in the Bay Area was nuts no there had to have been a thousand dolphins in the ban more yeah that was one of those days that's if you couldn't get a good dolphin shot you just you probably don't have a camera on you figured out there was like three Brownells we're like dude we see like a brown elegant few times a year in all sin there's three like in our media area we talked about that yeah no but we were talking about the Brownells and so how many like different pods there is because there was a herd marker yeah because there's only like one in each pod kind of yeah so for there to be that many and there was more than three like the next day we had a couple - yeah everyone started looking comparing pictures going realizing oh we all saw a different there so no yes Aaron Chelsea and you guys each had different ones in your photos yeah they have a got a lightning bolt above there yeah it looks like yeah they're cool racing stripes or something yeah one day we had common dolphins from Mulligan Hill which is like almost a Moss Landing from Monterey all the way to the point there was just this big line of dolphins coming into the bay it was so cool you just see in the binoculars all the way down we have inshore bottlenose I swear Erik I've never seen someone get so excited for ensure bottlenose but Caitlin whatever I love Bono's I still get excited everything I've no idea - but it's funny because I feel like that's every time I leave the harbor in Newport it's like encounter that day though okay yeah with our drinking water dude you're just being a hater because the Dolphins didn't want to play with you they didn't they actually didn't come over to or they did for like a second turned whatever when no another day we were driving through the jaws and John goes like you didn't know what's ayzik dolphin it was a sea otter it was pretty funny cuz it was just right in the middle and he said dolphin I was like where's like an otter or not that's fine [Laughter] [Music] well sorry about not uploading on Monday we're really busy guys Eric's on the water like 12 hours a day trips a day get it done my parents are in town so we're busy playing tourists and going on the boat a lot no well it doesn't matter if if one of us would do it like no matter what like there was times I could do it for sure I could do it all the time it's hard to coordinate three people scheduled in the summer time yeah and yeah with the 12-hour days it literally they have to play it by ear you know later the last minute was like do I have a third trip or do I not yeah and then also are you like dead tired or are you not pretty tired I'm old too so I'm not old and I'm tired yeah but I'm like twice your age unless I'm a vampire okay you guys so I have my trip in September and the San Juans I'm thinking about October is it October really nice time of year here oh yeah yes October November is I should make some trips here that's what I want to do yeah so yeah I was thinking October maybe do a couple day trips October is a really nice month and the beginning of November can be pretty nice too I need to know I need to know if I'll ever get lunch feeding into the sunset ever again never I don't even know what my camera settings were whatever happened was just a magical moment look I didn't know what I was doing can't you go back and look at the photo and look at this I lost all the RAW files from that day I just have it like it saved on my like your shot account on Nat Geo like that's it I don't even know and it was like my first photo that ever like God like a hundred likes on that Gio's like you can submit them you know like a daily dozen type thing and I was like I was on my way to Vegas and I was like oh my god I would be like put on here and then I got there and it didn't make the cut but it was still they got like a little check on there and not a check like a ribbon on it saying there was a kitchen that's cool blue checkmark the blue checkmark yeah he's verified blue ribbon it was a ribbon blue ribbon for not first place any unusual sight and nothing but oh the leatherback mean you encounter the other day oh yeah that was so cool I wish we could share that all our friends I didn't see we didn't see it but other other boats in the bay Kate and Kate and Tim got to see yeah the Otters fantasy fast tracked the high spirits got to see it sorry that's my dog yeah Lacey's adding her two cents with the squeaky toy if you can hear it in Morse code okay wait you guys do you guys want look at the Sharks yes yeah that'd be fun let's go let's find someone to take us in a little boat we can rent one of the ones that I'm gonna tie us all to my drone and fly us out there oh okay and then drop Caitlin off and Erik drop me in there I'm ready I'd love to be in the water with those animals they're so little you like you just push their mom in them like a puppy you'll put Caitlin is actually condoning petting great wait no I'm not gonna pet I'm not gonna pay any fish depends on a message popular what use your oils yeah I don't want to get my human by salt air goddamn fish a Garibaldi you pets I'm dick I've had to fight me back home no I purposely pet one but I've seen the safe in my face 20 times I'll be all ceiling Cod attack scuba divers when they're on their nests every day people ask me if I'm swimming with the whales on my life video from above water and salt imagine Q live stream underwater with a way someone told me today they're like how come you guys putting your GoPro in and I'm like well you can only see like six feet first of all it's super dark under the water trust me I would have a GoPro inner or have an underwater housing if and push that under the water but a lot of times the visibility isn't so many encounters we had the last few days this would be the best time to actually like today and then because I used to film underwater a lot and you even when they're not that far away you really can't see cuz it's so green and murky like they could be five feet from you and you really can't see him yeah so much phytoplankton yeah I mean it then I'm glad the oceans all murky and green because it means it's productive but yeah it gets really hard to film underwater when that happens yeah but it means we got healthy water we're serious about the shark thing yeah well okay sharks tomorrow afternoon we'll be good we already measured the kayak thing the bioluminescence past oh we did the new the new moons tonight so I guess we could go tonight last minute you can just go I'll go right now we go you just go ourselves and wiggle our hands around it's not gonna be next Eric because when he falls a him not I'm just kidding Eric's never falling off his kite he said the water was warm though yeah yeah because he's in the slough yeah and I'm one of those psychos like oh yeah so calm and the guy was like you look so cool that's so cool cuz he's swimming and all the boat yeah no way yeah I just swam back I just push the kayak to the dock and I didn't went back like a little cloud of jelly but neat things happen in the summer here is the warmer months that's why we're talking about baby white sharks and bioluminescence we get 20 yeah sharks Wow let's go tomorrow I'm going tomorrow you guys have to go tomorrow I think the people get that aren't listening to this okay and off air we I gotta tell you the chip story oh yes you did I can't believe I got to tell you but yeah I don't know if there's been any other crazy sightings on our coast the shirataki nature cruise I saw our knocks beaked whales either yesterday you guys can't make up their are not speak twills actually our newly declared species cuz they used to think they were Baird's beaked whales but they got enough stranding and live citing data to determine they actually are a different species but they look very similar courage I like that that's for a t-shirt brand flipper flap I'm going to share toka we should go they have them you guys don't even like to travel what Oh North Atlantic right whales gone next week and then almost oh wait what are you leaving oh not on September I'm diving next week and then I'm leaving yeah gonna go dive in the Jolla yeah the little leopard sharks something else I'm doing we got going on a cruise and I'm going to what's that place called Baja in March that's next year dude that's 2020 dude we're keeping it in 2019 speaking of 2020 I got nothing I don't know what I wanted tonight Tony I'm living one day at a time one all day trip at a time just one trip one trip it's good white shark in tomorrow hey you guys wait you guys haven't told people why day why they're here why I have three spots left on my all day trip there's one and two of you guys I'm not paying to go home I won't be here member I'm spoiled Lacey you owe me money um okay we could go white sharks tomorrow but I have to work on the 1:30 trip so so you don't know guys north part of the Monterey Bay is actually a white shark hot spot for it's a new young a new deal yeah it's a good ship yeah really like New Brighton State Beach that little pocket cement ship all the way the capital is like hotspot right yeah so they're still trying to figure it out actually the aquarium did put out some new information about it two months ago three months ago Sal Jorgensen had some they had some big PR thing about it but they think it's just like a kind of a nursery area like the Channel Islands is for white sharks they just got pushed up there several years ago during the warm water blob and then they just like keep going back there cuz yeah go back they have Phillip a tree so they like go back to the place these young boys young white sharks are just eating fish in the surf line - so yeah under perch and things like that that's what they live to eat there's also usually loads of schools of pinhead anchovies over there like when I went over there and a little boat a couple years ago there yeah but after bait ball I wondered I don't think the white sharks you guys barter with that probably what's eating those anchovies is probably what hold on are you gonna be okay how's it gone again sneezing but this news never came okay do you guys think that the Sharks are kind of like doing with the humpbacks is or they're just starting to come back I'm sure they were fished yeah white sharks actually came back because when gillnetting was allowed in our coastal areas they actually wiped out love our our white sharks and then it took a few decades for them to recover so that's why a lot of people think so many young white sharks are showing up more because obviously animals are just more abundance so do you think they're reclaiming an historic habitat that's what I think yeah making the claim yeah yeah I think so interesting Oh especially here I mean we're in the red triangle and can we have our basking sharks back then because like we'll be very normal here asking shirt holder I'm being greedy maybe needy greedy both I want the basking sharks back me too but yeah I'll trade basking sharks for great ways yeah basking sharks would be cool half and half half half yeah we'll send some back somewhere else and them but just take out without you go down the coast a little bit yeah and send the Sen Theodore up the coast yeah so I saw him Big Sur a sea lion eating a mola mola but no whales the whole time I was going down the coast you couldn't find a way on dick sir nope and I looked oh okay I'm kidding are your eyes okay yeah there's a whale spotter dude I sunset at point-p nose I saw lots of humpback whales eyeballs yeah the other day we were like literally like we could have tied up to the buoy to watch whatever it is right there yeah there was a couple right around the buoy breaching and stuff it was pretty fun to watch from from the point okay I got we got a message from a listener that we should do trivia I don't know the name offhand and on my phone on me who sent it in but I think that's actually a great idea let's make a list of questions oh I'll make them because you guys are nerds so I'll make the questions and then we'll each person ask answer it and then I'll say it right or wrong well probably you guys will tell me if its leaders gonna moderate us playing trivia yeah oh I'll do it against both you guys you guys go against each other cuz I probably don't know it anyways and plus I'm looking up the questions oh all right we'll see what kind of trivia questions you come out post later all right I'm gonna do or we could have people send us trivia questions hey or I'm gonna you know how in school you have to like read a paragraph and then like you have to answer questions about the paragraph I might send you guys a couple sheets out of the Marine Mammal book I bought mmm oh and you guys don't have to know facts some of these whales hmm I'll think of something just know the next podcast there's gonna be some questions you better answer yikes Eric's scared he's shaking his boots I'm never scared [Laughter] I'm ready hit me hit me with some whale questions and I thought it would be cool maybe one time we could all do a like a narration of an animal like the sea lion speech or something Slater always wants to do the sea lion speech for me so maybe we should let him have his moment I let him do it and I had to make him slow down he does a really good job I gotta get him hear you when you talk too fast listen up she like seals office boom we're out woah dude calm down and then the people are like whoa why are you looking at whales that's how fast he's at the sea lion speech I don't think they know I think I'm just really excited that day to do it sometimes I hand him the mic and he gets scared hey I'm not a real podcaster okay sir you started lip-syncing lip-syncing songs and I gave it a mic there today with it off though yeah you like that I could have had it on but I was lip-syncing I took a video of it do you want me playing oh I take plenty of videos of him trying to narrate the trip I do I do a great job it makes a great attempt alright well again you guys were sorry that we were late on this episode yes but we'll try to do better as the summer closes we probably won't be not busy till how long ding I don't know what are we gonna do while you're on your cruise well Skype or FaceTime or oh yeah Eric you have you do have a Mac now so you can fit wait are you gonna have enough Wi-Fi to do that no no the grip should that satellite okay we'll have to figure it out maybe when you're in port yeah I think I'm in Norway for the longest time and then do you think you're gonna be on the upper deck looking for whales appointed yes like 24 hours you can do what you want dude I don't know I've never been on a cruise cruise ship scare me there's too many people you better find whales I'm born to find whales wait a second dude you're going to Norway in September yeah wait where are you leaving from France so you're flying to France find it France then up to northern Norway and across the North Atlantic I'm going to do any northern bottom Scotland with our Islands then Iceland Greenland and then towards Canada okay you can't come home till you see northern bottlenose well awesome probably won't see me for ever ever yeah I know people that seen him out of Iceland oh I still need to go back to Iceland and see the white beak dolphin yes I messed up literally the day or two after I left I saw and I think they smell killer whales eat them well actually white beet dolphins are pretty big that becoming intense are they what they're like oh I think they're big yeah that's big they gotta eat bottlenose right yeah I didn't even think about that do you think they ever eat a part of our shores who do you think that like the cheese eat the transients eat offshore bottlenose they can catch him I'm sure they would yeah yeah the Rizzo's dude I honestly could see offshore bottlenose stunting on gila rolls back I can see this you miss me that's how good an officer officer bottle-nosed is I don't know we may never know I don't know I've seen it I mean I haven't seen them interact killer else but I've seen them go crazy in the wake yeah hi Eric how high can those things get mmm I say he's like 20 feet oh my god yeah a productive yeah you body legs yeah I've worked on triumphant last spot oh there's tall boats and it seems like they literally almost a level he's sometimes I said you got I think the deck is already six or seven feet off the water yeah so like if they're getting eye level with you that's ten feet no problem yeah no that's no I I've seen them in the wheelhouse window like jumpin next to oh my god and I'm like do that at all it's it's a rarity to get that high but they're capable that I've had them like I was like I want a second deck and I'm looking honestly there's there's no better show no it's such a good it is there's nothing like that picture of that Orca chasing that was it the white center heart porpoise music it's like 15 feet in the air wait that picture of a killer well it's like yeah that's like way up where I don't know where that's from suppose he was chasing a dolphin and they're just like like which straight after it and well I think there's a photo with of one with the dolphin and there yeah yeah there's one of Emma from a few years ago but those guys in the skiff actually were the reason why Emma and her pot almost lost the whale cuz they drove right over the middle of the hunt I was not happy with those people that day and then they got these great photos and people were like oh my god how lucky I was like yeah cuz they harassed the whales for two miles um but there's some other photos like that - like I have a few like that not not that high she's got a few like that not that high but yeah I got my first killer whale you know or you know head-butting a harbour porpoise he's a couple weeks ago oh yeah and there's enough yeah you know what though I was filming with my drone a Pacific white-sided hunt here oh yeah a couple years ago and I actually let someone hold my camera and shoot photos and they got like super out-of-focus photos of the same thing I got the same thing I got from the drone but they got him Frankie I was so sad like I was like I wish I didn't have the drone up and I would have just shot photos because I would have got probably the most epic like it was like a head-on killer role happened in the white side was later he was flying that was like Christmas time or something I was out at home visiting my family and I saw the video and I was like oh man someone else needs to move to Monterrey so that we can get killer well crazy again because whenever someone moves here and starts working they like show up for a week or why don't you just leave town no it doesn't work that way I already left that's true it's like a fresh move you got to be a new person coming I've already quit and came back twice he's taking one for the team I tried to do that for you guys but it didn't work that's alright we'll have our day they'll be back in the fall it'll be fine yes listen to me when I say these things that's why amber how you were whining in Jude you're like ooh the Wills and then now look at him yeah no I looked at my log at June yeah last June was not as good as last last year I was gonna ask you can you look at your log for October November see when we saw them then yeah definitely the qdubs yeah yeah so I'm like I said I'm gonna do the all day trips in October laughs yeah last year and he knows funny is my friend Erik always comes but you've never been on one of my trips oh so weird Kailyn oh sure it was like Eric's play you've never come dude that's good Erik is working on the boat that you charter so what all right I'll try and take the day off so I can go to you get spot over November well nurse podcast will sponsor it well then we'll do like a free idea you're gonna say well nurse sticker now we got to do something cooler than that fine Kaitlyn will run around and have everybody you can take a selfie we don't like touching you know I'm touching too you know that you guys are weird what dates October anytime in October so anyways Kaitlyn's theory is I think she's told me this before is that the killer must come back in the fall because the elephant seals are starting to come back to there but they're always there mm October 2000 I mean 2018 October was not a good time for or you shut your mouth but how many about November there's like 30 humpbacks on every trip November we started getting bad weather so we didn't go out that much right yeah I'm practice on double digits yeah last November was bad that's I remember I was hey not selling my old okay what about 2017 but that's your theory right yes that the big male sea lions are back in central California and the elephant seals are starting to come back towards Shore wait a second to the beaches for breeding how come there's elephant seals year-round even though they leave so okay some of the young ones are there most of the time like off and on the beach but they're molting right now in the summer then they go back out offshore again so they're right now Billy yes so they're they're from like late November through January and then so they will eventually completely the beach yeah well the adults will the little ones there'll always be some year round yeah so October I mean October 2017 we had I personally had only two Orca days what about September 4 kilowatts I bet you I'll bet you that was December we had them wow that was a day the 51a showed up three days in the Ford five days of Orca and September 2017 five days of killer whales in September yes in the 51 days and should be like literally three days in a row I mean I always say it's two or three times a month during the non-peak well when does that know September September 17 was really good for working oh that was a year yeah it was a pretty nutty year that yeah right my first day as a resident here yeah number mfon out of the water yeah porpoising Louise hey I'm telling you guys when the killer whales are here it's good you like it nevermind it's not that good actually sometimes they're traveling but tonight they scare everything else away yeah I don't know why I thought it was good I just like seeing them yeah yeah that's good for me that's a bias you know it's a scientific opinion no no it's not you don't know that yes I do it's an opinion yeah it doesn't mean scientific opinions not really a thing yeah that's not possible science is only facts science is objective science facts are their opinions its facts sure it's supposed to be facts seven people lie yeah did she mm-hmm so they're not even actually whales people are not whales no what Oh didn't they talk about that in the movie how some places they're starting to consider like primates and possibly whales as Ana beings with human Sentinel beams Sentinel beings yeah did I just say a word Sentinel or sentient sentinels not right sentient beings where they would have rights similar to humans because they do have the ability to like make free choices and things so free choices yeah I get free choice every day there so you can't like put it like what was the name of the the chimp that they did they defended Tommy or something yeah something like that yeah Lucy is one of they Lucy Lucy Lucy's opossum back to sixth-grade history so yeah so we we thought it was pretty interesting to watch long gone wild it's definitely something to kind of expand your horizons and think differently about the captive industry and learn more that maybe you didn't know I also think that I learned a lot about how the captive industry worked from that book by Jason Colby but then long gone wild was kind of a good follow up and like the visual version of some of the information that was in the book so yeah that's my kind of two cents on the whole thing yeah that was a pretty interesting documentary to watch yeah yeah it definitely gave I wrote down some notes to of other things I want to look at more so maybe when I have some time to look at it more I'll talk about it on another episode I wrote some notes on the whiteboard while we were watching it and if you guys are ready for next week's episode on whale trivia between Caitlin and Eric send me some questions you can send it to the well nerds I'll just block them from it what okay fine you can send it to my own Instagram but let's stump these ding-dongs with some whale trip bring it on so our Instagram is at whale nerds and if you wanted DM Slater at Slater more photography if you want to keep the questions secret for me and Eric I guess you can yeah you're dang right we can I'm gonna beat you guys literally it's just getting every time you guys both get one wrong I'm gonna get a point what No yeah for dumping you know oh no you know it I used to say it last summer I used to say that's people on the boat or try and stump me during the trip I already know when that will get you right now and Eric will get the point what I'm not saying it for next week all right you guys well thank you so much for listening again sorry that we were late this week just schedules were pretty busy but there's lots of whales in the bay so me to Monterey holy cow come on ray Oh better asked about why brother should asked about blue whales I know you guys didn't see it I guess Kate got one in towards moss I guess maybe straight up yes you did okay yeah pretty touch-and-go but they have been coming through and there has been some krill so yeah it's always good come out for a couple days if you're trying to see something specifically yeah then you might get it I really I actually just put up a picture of one so okay I think they got one today oh cool so yeah was it two weeks ago we had a whole bunch you guys all saw him right yeah yeah I didn't get this you I saw one with you Eric oh yeah the Fuki one yeah the fluky one the one that has a tail and stuff that's big yeah alright guys thanks so much for listening have a great rest of your week everybody tonight yes all right so it's Wednesday have it have a great weekend and we'll see you guys next Monday hi everyone thanks for listening

-

hello everyone and welcome back to the welders podcast this is episode number 31 are we gonna go here by myself my name is Slater we got kicked off the podcast episode 31 32 gives it whoa episode 32 my name is Caitlin are you guys ready guys later to hit you with some whale facts whoa dude we're playing trivia already yeah we're going right in here you didn't even ask me nothing that was that's exactly why we're going right into it because you guys need to give me the scientific name for a walrus go oh no I know this is something something something something dude oh I have it written in my planner I think I don't know we can't look at your note so you guys both taking a big ear on that one taking a break Elle on that one that's 1.4 sub but what is it it's OD banais Ross Maris told you dude what exact let me read that thing yeah here read it Oda Bennis yeah Maris you guys aren't even reading in the right language no dude I speak a little Latin all right are you guys ready yeah hit me with it all right what is the Latin name for dwarf minke whale baleen Optra rut all right if you're close thank you hey something and then no it's all right Ahri's aureus it's that and then another word oh it's a three word yeah it's a three-way oh yeah but the third word isn't isn't like a scientific name so is it Baylin Optra or aureus or yeah it's a Kudrow akuto rose truck tata strata subspecies in wild already oh man I need I can't see that I think this is actually more fun having Slater read them after the class I'm just saying that's oh yeah me and JJ actually do this in the wheelhouse ah cute or estrada I can't even say it I need a lesson that's a lot of letters of science names you guys are pretty much well ok you're asking us animals that we don't normally look at like yeah that's support Eric what's humpback whale character I know vaguely all right I got later what's gray well it's rich yes okay listen I got one that air can do and you can't what is the name of the thing in the top of the humpback whales mouth corpus cavernosa maxilla rest yeah yeah I knew but I can't reproduce it that's that sort of play word with a mallet at one point for Eric should be point five points even named all the Dolphins in the Monterey Bay do you even know the answer yeah we should all know this one okay Oh potential or yeah potential or okay potential striped dolphin what okay but they never alive when they show up yeah there are stranded whale pins rize's dolphins common dolphins intro boners dolphin dolphin also possible pilot whales short-finned pilot whales not possible dude they've been seen before yeah but when in 2000 or 1998 a lot of the commercial guys for offshore I've seen it before there must be like warm water currents that come way in from like way out yeah further out okay I have it I have a bonus question for you what are the two lesser known species of beaked whales that can be seen in Monterey Bay one of them washed up in Moss Landing last month oh and so what does the teeth oh that was santa cruz Caitlin it was hard was it yeah I was higher up was it that is no coulier's in barrage it was a hub speak to l wasn't it did they confirm it because remember there was like first they said that was this there's a Stein injures ten injures yeah also what's the scientific name for a narwhal mana dawn is it mana donk today mana dawn is that the first part whatever is it no mana dawn come on a dog well this one's kind of cool mono saris Monoceros yeah so belugas and narwhals are in the mana daunted a mammal genus gina genus um because they do not have very many teeth ocean dolphins all right can you guys name all the ocean dolphins oh just kidding I think that book is also out of date there's a different species now since that one was written okay where can you see okay where can that Haley's the pale dolphin oh sure Haley's dolphin you know what no more trivia Slater's getting mad me why keep quizzing us guys you guys I don't know any questions I wasn't prepared just keep flipping the pages I got one let's just ask each other questions hey Eric what did you see today Oh today oh my God he's actually you know what today was probably one of my today it was probably one of my best well watching days ever as far as number of whales go a little bit I was really happy I don't know tear fell from my I like the beaked whales or letter backs but we probably had about 60 humpback whales during our four-hour trip before through that power trip amazing yeah I read it on my happy whale and it was busy that's a lot oh I have a question about happy well dude so when I when I submit them one at a time is that lame can I just do all of my wants you can so I'm not sure if your yours is said to there's a yes he died he did it yeah so what you do each and count and then encounter isn't each individual see an encounter is technically one individual so you can put a bunch of photos per encounter do you see I'm saying so let's say you got two pictures our friend you put them two in each other what about groups yeah is it more that what if it's more than one well yeah I want to put like so happy offered that's technically a separate encounter so after you submit every single one individually oh sure I do it's really easy it's just what do mean I did it I did it this morning I submitted like 10 flukes this morning mmm so you know how it on the right hand side there's a boxes at add encounter each encounter would be a individual whale but you can put in like say we've got different angles it would go into no I don't say that but what I'm saying is if I get Fran they came or if I get Fran you know that fin whatever all the different names if I get all those looks and they're all in the same coordinate mm-hmm so just put people I'm putting the same coordinates for each encounter so just you have to submit each one individually it would be nice if you could just throw like you know I mean if they're all feeding in one school of anchovies and there's 15 whales and you get you know all 15 of their flukes it'd be nice if you can just put upload all the flukes to one folder and then put the you know the mean mm-hmm but I guess it needs to look through them individually so yeah there might be little tricks may I talked to like earlier yeah I'm sure there's a trick to it easy program yeah a massive file as well like just send him a thumb drive or something on that so you said we saw Fran yesterday I don't think I can do this but she has been in the second portion that I thought I saw her briefly today as well but I do not think I got her fluke photo yeah she's been by you guys it seems like I don't think I've seen her north of moss yeah but I was fairly preoccupied of trying to find something else today oh oh yeah we saw an entangled whale and it took about two hours of watching this feeding group to actually figure out that it was entangled because the buoys are like as soon as the whale arches its back to dive the buoys gone so we couldn't even figure out what whale it was on for like 30 more minutes and I think I finally am finding some photos of the whale I think it is and we called it in to the hotline excuse me and send some photos to Noah already and then the entanglement team was out there in the afternoon trying to find it again and the Atlantis did see it briefly but it was one whale in the middle of like 15 other whales and it was just feeding with all the rest of them and I was like oh my god we're never gonna be able to find this thing did anyone get a job no unfortunately no one that was out that had a drone that I know of and there was only one brief sighting of it during the trip in the afternoon but I did I'm working up some photos and I'm gonna send them over to the entanglement folks out of Moss Landing and then also to Justin Vespucci and we'll see what happens I'm out all day tomorrow too so I'm hoping that we see it again and because it the buoys disappear already before it dives I think it's on its PEC Feiner it's in its mouth hmm because the reason the feeding group yeah so I'm wondering if maybe it's I'm hoping it's just draped on the PEC fin and it's gonna come off I realize I just didn't have my mic next to my mouth but if he if that whales in the feeding group most likely he's feeding hopefully yeah I mean he was there was no shortage of feeding and it was really hard to keep track of the whale so I mean to me that's a good sign the whales moving fast hopefully there's no pot on it yeah crab pot yeah you know what this brings up guys since we obviously are have a bunch of whale enthusiasts listening right now what should I wait we are always know the answer but what should someone do Caitlin if someone encountered what I did today is I called the NOAA entanglement response hotline which is 1 877 SOS whale so type it all in phonetically but with no Eon the end of whale and someone will answer and ask for your location what vessel you're on your name a good number to call you back at and then if you have photos they'll tell you where to submit them and for me actually just invisible called me back directly he's like the lead response coordinator he's at a conference about crab gear today and he was like can you actually just send me some backup camera photos so I can flash these around another thing I'm at because it's super relevant today and I was like sure look like Dungeness crab gear to me there's no tag on it from what I'm seeing in the photos but I think I have some dorsal fin shots of the whale so hopefully we can get some more information tomorrow I'm hoping the whale sticks around in one of the feeding groups yeah so when you call that number to usually ask for some basic information folks or what they really want this documentation like you know take a picture of the gear if you can the direction of travel with your and you know using your your best experience or a personal judgement how the condition of the well you know it's moving fast a bit slow this doesn't look too hot and all that stuff okay gives them a heads up what to expect so the response team can even kind of prep themselves for what to expect well is they ask you for GPS coordinates Vesely I was on time it was sighted any other detailed information I could give if I could see the gear clearly on the whale direction of travel obviously yeah and then the entanglement boat that came out is actually someone we know julia was out on the marine life studies boat and so she texted me and asked for more information I called him when we got back to the dock and was like you're gonna have to be really patient cuz really hard to figure out where this whale plus what were you guys anyway we were only like four miles northwest of the harbor okay so yeah be on the lookout tomorrow yeah yeah definitely keep an eye out I'll keep an eye out tomorrow too but yeah it was really hard to it took us a while to even figure out there was an entangled whale in the grave and then like remember that one year is all three of us just happened to be there so they've got that awesome drone footage stuff like that really helps so the team can really know what to expect and actually see their wraps along the body and all that yeah one time Slater and I jumped on Kate's boat with you and if you hadn't put the drone up they would have had no idea how that whale was entangled yeah because it just had that one line on the back and then you could see the PEC fins were wrapped up I thought it for sadly if so many whales now so many but I mean like six that's quite a bit of you like yeah it is a bummer so that was pretty sad to see today but it isn't I think you know some people might find it interesting and helpful to know what to do in case you do see it and let us know folks if you probably oh no I really think we should do an episode with someone who can probably talk a little bit more about the techniques and strategies of rescuing whales it was and don'ts yeah yeah maybe we can get Julius and she was yeah with me today yeah that'd be a good idea I think that would be interesting I mean a lot of us all of us always have that you know we all have good intentions and a lot of people think well we're just jump in there with a knife but no thank you people god I know that that is the worst thing you can do well it's dangerous for you and it's dangerous for the will yeah and people have died from rescuing whales that doesn't look that simple yes but yeah I think really the right thing is the prevention side but until we have a better way to do it definitely always call it in and that's the number we just gave out is only for the US there's other entanglement responses and other places around the world but you'll have to look at where you are for the correct correct number to refer though that's good cool yes I did get the photo edited and I'm gonna send those out so we have so remember dorsal I do remember before ahead like Justin's direct cell phone number I think the 1-800 number it wasn't a whole office in Hawaii that would pick up I don't know some guy named John answered it today and he sounded like he was on a cell phone well yeah who I was taking away hey Justin yes he from downtown yeah I remember he's always good he was a conference about lacy wants to join Eric on the podcast yeah if only you could see her now fort number but how many it's 2019 right how many entanglement said we had in 2019 I heard of too many no one really says anything until the end of the year yeah I haven't heard anyone say anything on the radio really maybe one this years yeah it just worries me because yeah like here's been gone for so long it's like have you been wrapped up for a while where everybody wondered if maybe because the whales were feeding on fish that was like pinned on the bottom if they like swept it up like if it was a pot that was down there or loose gear that was down there and it swept it up with its PEC fin or something when it was rolling around yeah and there's that stuff that sometimes completely disappears during high tide that's yeah Lawson yeah I don't know but we'll see but otherwise we had like 40 to 45 whales on our end of the bay so there's gotta be over 100 humpbacks because they had whales yeah Chris to you that's what we were thinking today yeah exactly which was pretty awesome I mean it was really calm this morning and glassy and a little bit misty mm-hmm and it kind of made you feel like like is this what it used to look like in the 1700s like just whales everywhere coils of whales 10 to 15 whales in each group as far as the eye could see like is that what it used to be like in Monterey they're looking at some of those whaling records I mean there was like it really looked like sperm pills and write wills Lorne Pacific right whales were plentiful here it's kind of crazy to think that that was once a thing ya know it's like I pray to see either one of those animals that'd be amazing you know yeah for sure but it was really nice I hope it continues because we've ruined a lot of people on whale watching so ya guys are listening come join all three of us out here on the water it's been really good really really really really good you think sperm whales were sighted like like more than once a week yeah probably do you think he's always been male sperm whales or do you think like the females and calves would come up this far I look no nursery pots I've ever seen up here I mean Slater used to see him I mean we had that happen twice to us down south but now that you mention it I'm not sure if everyone like it might be too cold yeah that's true young ones usually what the one reward okay that doesn't make any sense for the females and the cab no cabs are skinny yeah we're not very big come on gray wheels are born on their way down above us like that doesn't make sense because some whales are born in colder areas yeah like thinking about like killer whales and they when they move around a lot but no one's gotta move around where they're where they dive to was much colder anyways right sure baby not gonna take a calf down there yeah they do a lot of babysitting at the surface is it there a lot but I think that they can handle the cold their food is we're in the canyons yeah yeah squid so usually people this other thing is like how is it how's the deep-sea ecosystems change since we started removing all these other things under the ocean we have no idea like there could have been way bigger squid back in the day or something crazy and we just had no clue they killed all the sperm whales here they said they killed a bunch here yeah yeah they're down so long like but then they lay at the surface for a while so if you got nothing but time you could just sit there and wait till it comes up and it'll log forever you know fifty breaths in a row like when we saw the male whale here he was up for like 50 60 breaths at a time before he'd dive again how long do you stay down after that many breaths forty five minutes yeah cuz when I saw that big male mango down off what pals rarities it was yeah it was like 28 29 breaths in there stay down approximately thirty minutes it was pretty gnarly yeah the first time we saw the male sperm whale Everett and I saw it on a sea bird trip and it was only diving like 15 to 20 minutes mm-hmm and it wasn't even really fluking really yeah and then like a couple days later they saw it again and it was doing the long dives big tall fluke and stuff that's crazy how they show up like you see that big males once and then the next day or in recent days you'll see him again that's what happened in down south - really yeah mango will see multiple days yeah maybe you know they find a spot they like it they hang out yeah oh let's quit here I think I'll hang out and squid I don't know they say yeah who knows it's like it's funny how we just see humpbacks like we see other whales when I come back she's the main thing but like all these other whales definitely come through here b12 oh yeah and we just never see like in and were like out of all three of us say like we're we're each on the water water at least three days a week right between us all like how do we not like every day of the week is covered by getting too distracted by the humpbacks remember when the hydrophone was working there was you know days he would hear blue whales and you know no one would see him even a was really a herd sperm well one day and you know obviously no one found him yeah yeah they're mean it's pretty impressive how quickly you lose you lose an 80-foot long blue whale yeah even when you know they're that one one breath blue whales are we also lose track of them because after 20 minutes we have passengers on the boat yeah and they're like oh so over it yeah like I bet we could find it find it again but even if we did we're like no like if it pops up a mile away by the time we run it goes down 20 minutes again that's you know a quarter of their half of their trip yeah that's how I'd be it just it would take too much away from a regular whale watch trip well it's amazing what a difference like 10 miles offshore could make and like you just don't really do that on a short whale watch trip you know there could be like 10 fin whales 10 miles from our furthest point that we normally travel and we just you know never see him the fin whales are like oh yeah we're in the area but for us it's like 10 miles is another like hour on the trip yeah so many whales in Monterey Bay yeah Oh what was that did you someone have a question about blue Slater or something here it's in the Instagram I know they asked me if I was doing a blue whale trip but I mean to do a trip that's for blue whales would have to be like oh you know it's tough hey they're here right now yeah so I can do it I hope that we're gonna see them but I don't I mean September August or what I mean these are good months yeah I always come they come if they did sometimes it's better than others yeah it's true we say mid July through October for really good feeding humpbacks and for blue whales yeah so I do have a trip though I'm gonna do it on October 11th mmm are you gonna work it well boat do you work on Fridays usually the high spirits yeah okay that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do it on Friday okay so it doesn't mean when are you wait what's your friend eleven so all people listening are getting a pretty did you put online in or people getting this surprised we're getting a sneak preview well it's gonna be on it'll be next Monday yeah but I'm in the future right now so that's true realize that we can post these whenever or the future we can predict the future net I'm unposted it and I'm reposing at me oh my goodness alright you guys ready for some more trivia okay I'm gonna get you guys don't be asking me weird pinniped questions okay all right we're looking over my doing over here someone told me what kind of dolphin I saw when I was in Fiji it was a type of mouse it was and it was I would say I don't know is that what they are show me a map okay well I was in Fiji and these things were we were on like a what's it called like a fair like a flyer like Catalina flyer you ever seen that no okay like a like the black fin but way bigger yes and it takes a lot of people across islands okay okay and yeah ferry and these things were literally launching out 20 feet in there no problem off the bow they were bow riding and flying out in front of us splash they were definitely bottlenose 100% I think they're indo-pacific bottom that's what I said but as the people on the on I was like do you guys see dolphins or whales they're like nan and in like two seconds later we saw dolphins okay I'm confused but yeah and it's so funny because I like I so I was laying at the bow there's like 15 people laying down on the bow there's a big open bow and I was up there with like my wife's little sister my wife and dad I think we're all sitting about and then I see them and I was like don't say a word anybody live let me go get my camera because if I I had to go inside again I'm right if I did actually I had my camera I had to switch the lenses and do you know that someone sees dolphins yeah I'm freaking literally like One Flew jumped out in front about every scream and I'm like no side of like weasel my way through everybody but I ended up getting a couple shots but the water is just you know crystal clear blue and there these things are just launching out and then of course it's such a panic settings are wrong bad like you guys should cease later when he panics trying to take photos this is quite a site panic for those there's lots of ha I like panic if it's like I don't think Anna Kenney more really maybe like if yes residents wide open yeah I really wanted that wide angle so I'm gonna get that shot yeah there's a shot I have okay you were there with me err uh-huh it's it's like my most sold print it's it's literally when we had the ACS trip and the humpback was laying under the bow for like a half hour oh yeah and it fluked up like four feet off the bail that flu shot on the glassy water really wide angle yeah but the flukes still huge because it's from those two ladies direct yeah 120 frames a second yeah I've never seen someone you guys take care of that actually it wasn't that funny that would make anybody sick giving directs not in the face from if you don't get hit by it's a funniest thing I really like is this happening speaking of ACS they're doing theirs summer fundraiser on the 25th of August with discovery nice oh really fun stuff oh nice you guys if you can go on that trip I'd go because they're pretty lucky so much yeah we had a really cool trip last year too we didn't have friendly whales but we had big groups of feeding whales and the first group we came to there was dolls porpoise in the feeding group for like 10 minutes whoops yeah well something else is cool on an ACS trip Wow ships are cool mm-hmm okay so you know when I first moved here they had the National ACS thing oh yeah the conference the conference yeah okay so and there was like multiple boats yeah well they were we were watching lunch it was like November - all right yeah telling you guys November October November is a great time for humpbacks yeah I think they're just feeding know like we got a stock up yeah but so that was this trip where they were lunch feeding over and over and over in a whale breach in front of my lunch feeding humpbacks chunky did that today in front of the HMMWV egg blocked him yeah it's just like you know that like orange esky like lacy is asleep on top of air camera click it's too adorable me or Lacey Lacey oh we're back to trivia yeah just finished laters thought because I interrupted him with his cute dog the fall is great and I think if this month is anything as a hint the last few days it's gonna be a great rest of our summer and a good fall I'm excited there's a lot of whales what's the science name for teeth is their sign for that there's name for the actual teeth like the dentist would know it it gets more technical wait a second temptation in a dolphin they all have the same teeth all the way around yeah all right I got one for you guys yeah what type of teeth do shoot I don't even know an animal it is yeah tentacles like a whale shark dang it what kind of teeth does a crabeater seal have interlocking crazy-looking scary teeth I know they like like really loopy looking yeah like a sieve they can eat krill isn't that crazy that they can filter feed krill with their teeth yeah yeah it looks almost fake they're scary-looking teeth I don't like them it freaked me out this is the weirdest seal on the ribbon seals and you could see you can actually see them somewhere somewhere North Canada yeah when magically showed up to like Washington State a few years ago seal what seal in San Francisco like three years ago Marine Mammal Center guys I swear if you guys might call seal you can buy a new marine mammal of the world guide every year and every year they probably add like 15 new species it's like oh yeah but call seal where'd that come from I think that was in the book we just didn't know where's Lake Baikal is that like the Gulf Air doesn't know because it just got added yesterday oh no I'm just wondering if the new edition will have vaquita in it tear sorry being Nancy I'm gonna tell you guys about if you can't I have Akita oh speaking of that I think more information about the screening for Monterey let me see oh this was it something this showed up we're monitoring August 9 ooh that's gonna be fun where where did this show this ribbon seal that you're looking at in the book showed up in San Francisco two or three years ago the Marine Mammal Center responded to it it's so weird it was in 2017 because they also that same year had a Brutus whale wash up in the San Francisco area and I was like how do you get two very different species one wave down from the north and one way up from the south in the same year like what is happening in the ocean that brings them both to the same place their friend or frenemies Wow well let me tell you guys something it's possible for them to come here they're not that far they're just above us yeah just hop skip and a jump dude 3,000 mile for a mother so are walruses and they just don't stop by I mean if it's 1,200 to San Juan Islands so then probably another 2,000 up there we could make it if they're on the i-10 by 10:00 they'll be here I want to hear all right while we're stopped by if they can just stop by so easily I think you combine to say hey and then just go back they'll be fine all right you guys I'm done whale watching why because I'm going walrus watching I'm going Harbor she'll watch our ribbons you're watching and I'm going to Antarctica I have so many trips planned you guys I don't even know if I can be a friend wow you guys don't want to order any of them with me I do want to go in them with you my dog's falling asleep looking at my feet yeah she's cute your dogs really warm on my legs I hope she's not peeing no she's fine did you kick her off she's like half asleep now I don't know I think you guys just entertained her so she scooted a little bit off she was on the pillow okay what about all the baleen whales you could see in Monterey Bay name them name them bear named them easy do it great well fin well blue well Mickey well can you see Bruce was here I guess I'll wash up in San Francisco so why not about say well I think I've seen us a whale here JJ seen one you missed the most important one you missed the one that we do I don't miss it I just figured everybody knows cuz we talked about it in almost every ever every episode but you're on the boat naturalizing have you ever talked about humpbacks lying and like two hours into the trip what kind of again Oh today today yeah look what they saw in Newport today what I'm sorry bottlenose oh I want to see that it's so wait if we go down there will they still be there when I get there hold on the mask okay give me some chips will they still be there when I get there sorry everyone knows what your iPhone calls you now that's great they're not gonna be there she said Wow dang it have you ever had a baleen whale Grand Slam day so you've seen four Bailey I've seen first off I almost had a picture of it what I had a bluefin oh and a humpback in the picture okay but you need the four I lied I actually had two blue ELLs in one humpback but I definitely I don't know I feel like you were there for that day we had on some of those all day trips we were doing yeah last year you mean you had a blue L as well a side lunge with a humpback well in front of it they also do a side lunge on krill yeah yeah you guys I'm telling you there's some crazy stuff to be seen out there do you think that there's like okay say like 200 miles off no one's there zero people zero zero zero there fennels come back to those feet yes right now remember that bird trip a couple years ago on the backside of what was that San Clemente they had yeah they said there was like a hundred something finish yeah and they had videos of them all lunge feeding and stuff yeah why aren't we there dude they gotta tell us know someone he said give me a helicopter I'm flying around I want to fly on the Pacific like on a regular basis you need to get a job okay get a helicopter yeah my wife said she wants to be a helicopter pilot like where did that come from we're driving this and when I on she's like you know I think I might go my helicopter license oh right on then she could fly us around I'm ready I'll pay it scares me the helicopters are scary they offer lessons over there at specialized yeah we're real in watsonville to fly around that one here would you guys go and helicopter I did we did like tomorrow yeah hey we were supposed to look for sharks today yeah but then you guys called we had to record yeah and I work sorry I was busy looking at a lot of humpbacks Yankee also was very cute today can win that whole that well chunky I love that well stopped on at that dude literally you know when we call like rocky road or something yeah this nigger man that's mean okay chunky my favorite well it's what but you're not calling it cuz it's like a like a full-grown whale or anything you're callin out chunky because there's a chunk missing from its body yeah what's wrong with that if they're calling me tubby well they're calling that one calf lumpy with jazz I think well I want to call those everyone there's a lot of people want to call that blues jazz and blues by the way I'm submitting a further one of the whales I'm submitting a name but I'm not telling you what the name is can we name that other one fake out Batman while we need a waffle gobbling yeah I actually would like that tell-tell happy well Eric when you get another photo of that whale I wanna keep naming all of them like waffle goblin waffle goblin - bobgoblin AKA waffle goblin people hit people in mexico we're gonna be like what is this guy like who is latter more they're gonna be like a week okay but anyways my favorite whale was breaching right by the boat today and it was very cute people get both i just know that they named all the like they named all the residents like the name i dislike the most like there's Sachi Sachi that's weird what's it supposed to mean I don't know annoying do you guys I'm not kidding you could just flip this book and be like how how how how will I ever see okay weirdest ones for me in the marine mammals of the world are the river dolphins yeah but there's not that many but they're so bizarre I mean like they have unfused vertebrae in their necks so they can like bend their head almost all the way backwards any that are doing well spine no they're all yeah all the freshwater sell porpoises or dolphin are doing well they're all habitat losses really and also the pollution issue and the Rivers is not a pollution habitat lost nor all the runoff cuz Rivers is like yeah all the heavy mining operations just like run the effluent down the rivers the dolphins live in and okay so you guys we have to see a river dolphin dude they're freaky yeah I really want to film with the drone that like that one oh no no it's not river dolphin it's about like that I would oh my god I would die the freaking it's in the blue planet we're the second Florida Florida where they chased the mo it the techniques what about those bottlenose that work with the fishermen in Brazil mm-hmm catching the Dolphins you know the Dolphins heard the fish into the net and then I think the fishermen like feed them or something yeah it's like totally a relationship that has been going on for a long time yeah this girl Karolina that Jodi and I know published some work on a couple years ago about it all you have to do is trap their fish right and then when you have their attention yeah throw a fish and they eat it but yeah it's a really cool like symbiotic thing they have going on the bottlenose dolphin and salt and they teach the calves to do it they said like the moms will get in and show the caps how to do it dang it what's gonna be sad as if they like fish them until they're gone well either way they were gonna be eaten by the dolphin huh yeah but so as long as it often are getting enough food yeah and at night I'm sure the dolphins are feeding too and the fishermen are not working there by like during the day we help them during the night we eat a king what we want I mean it's a pretty easy meal during the day here I'll push them up for you and you know they're so amazing with you either every area they all have different techniques of getting food remember we're learning about the sponge feeding ones yeah where was she working again in the Caribbean yeah yeah so these dolphins take these like cup shaped sponges and put them over their beak so that when they're like trying to stir fish out of the rocks is great though it doesn't scrape their face yeah science in the and yeah we were listening to this big-time lecture about an only question Caitlin can I ask them is if they would still be sponge treating when she got there wait let me I had twenty dollars like right in front of you and you didn't do it you would have earned free $20 you scared I'll tell you what watching the intro bottlenose feed from the drone is actually really cool I've seen him catch a halibut yeah what yeah I got a picture of them they eat a hell of it oh yeah okay we're going down south strictly for bottlenose no cuz that's all they're really seeing right now anyway watch now they're gonna have so many easy-peasy Peter get you up again I'm gonna cry not to move to there to see killer Rosa we're gonna see load to killer a killer well capital of the world we should talk about that anyway Eric what's going on at Dana Point Dana Point trademarked the phrase dolphins in whale capital watching a dolphin and whale watching capitals oh I get it dude it's for sure the dolphin capital of the world I would say it kind of I mean dude they have the most confidence that if they would have put in quotes like common dolphin capitals oh that's fine I don't I mean they do see lots of gray whales it's true in the winter they have great gray whales yeah they probably have the best grade watching Dana Point like from Laguna through Dana Point it's probably the battery while watching anywhere along the whole entire coast I'll put I'll put some money on that well I put it on red because this is what they do look they come way the big ones all go way off the coast the young ones stay real close to shore but they go straight because California arches right yeah they go straight off they go through the Channel Islands Catalina once the Catalina boom they angle it right towards Dana skip Newport Huntington but some of them do you go in there like you know some of them go to a point point now what vicente internal isn't you know near like la harbor and all that yeah so a lot want a hug coastline here yeah we in fact helping out at the point for senate you know very well census there's yeah some of them are so close to the cliff that you lose them you learn have to step up yeah you have to stand closer to the edge to them there was I remember this one year there was a day I mean there was like a month like probably February something we would go exactly like 11 to 13 miles every single day and catch them coming yeah at an angle from Catalina yeah the original census used to be over there in Catalina we do have an offshore route and I've been in the Channel Islands I've seen them actually we've in between other cop in Santa Cruz Island so I've been on a fishing boat off of the Osborne which is like a hundred miles past Catalina behind it or it might be like a hundred miles from shore I don't know but it's behind it and I've seen great was out there so do you think they go way off sometimes they go on the back side of the Farallones - and that's like 25 miles off shore yeah Catalina is 25 - I don't know Channel Island zero like all different like 40 yeah and I'm a cop it's really close SBI is pretty close to right yeah yeah yeah so so the reason why we're kind of snickering about this if you don't know about the whale watching capital of the world thing first of all it's a little pretentious but we also work in a place that's very pretentious and already had trademarked the phrase the whale watching capital of the world or the whale capital of the world what is it eBay the whale capital of the world I don't know I there was a link that was productive definitely trademarked there's some people on the wharf they weren't up like mocking any of them like it's still a great place to go yeah it's completely different than Monterey if you want clear water a chance at like a away thousands of calls thousands of thousands you want to be warm yeah yeah exactly and not be cold and all that nonsense yeah then go down south but if you want like 50,000 humpback whales come to Monterey yeah especially in the winter I'd say Monterey can be pretty good for gray whales especially at the peak but it comes with some tough weather in the winter a lot of the time and the whales are very business-oriented remember my first week here right guys um it's 60 the swells are 6 to 8 we're gonna cancel and they just looked at me that goes crazy welcome to Monterey another thing is what you know there's wealth feeding in New York right now yeah gotta go I've been watching there I follow that page I think it's a Gotham wild page no no no American American princess oh it's a huge boat yeah all their boats over there big yeah they're like fairies or something Oh Andi they spend like a weaker I just see I need to explore the city they want to go hopefully hopefully the humpbacks are still there when we get there well you better go right there that long when do you leave for your trip we could go next week which trip he leaves end of September I already look at flights for know mid-september I'm leaving and then next weekend leaving the run back down south to do so you could actually before you come home Eric stop over there they saw whales Natalie you're right over there yeah I'm gonna be in Canada hey yeah you talked about are you going to Quebec go back and then I can find out in New York might be but you're going back yeah and even if it's not going off in New York they'll still be seen I'm out of the Gulf of Maine so Massachusetts or Maine you could go out of like Bar Harbor you could go out of Gloucester you should try them do the fin whales you guys back with them - winds yeah in tattoo sack they are follower or listener Matt what you see hanky sir and tattoo sack no you can see believes there sometimes it's in the Gulf of st. Lawrence st. Lawrence yeah - no I'm not - minke whales and lots of Grecia maybe way up in the Gulf but like and he's in the sound like it's right where huh yeah you're gonna want to get out of that all right yeah I'm I'm in Canada hopefully they'll still be there when I get there I can see what time I have but that's a good idea I can probably just stay east coast for a little bit yeah I mean that's how I ended up going out there the first time is in Halifax was that Marine Mammal conference and I was like well since I'm already flying all the way out there I might we'll stop off on the eastern seaboard and check out whale watching there before I go up to the conference yeah but you went well watching another country yeah I know but Scotia Canada Wow do you have to I said I said in Mexico but where have you guys been well watching other countries Canada Mexico in the u.s. Oh Canada technically because I owe ya dang it but I mean like I've never been anywhere East Coast besides Iceland yeah I really North Atlantic population are there humpbacks all more they're way more white yeah even in Boston we're doing it or whether PEC fins away wait Gloucester I went to Boston the first time but now I've been going on to Gloucester with my friends was Gloucester where the right yes that's cool it's a very quaint little fishing town but did you see the all the plaques in the wall of all the people who passed away no I don't know where it is yeah I don't either it used to be like they used to have like that legal seafood places that they actually had the bone there was you good in the perfect storm they use that as the memorial if you think that market might be closed there's one that was like a huge international auction or something there by catching swordfish they can and tuna who are they catching in the movie swordfish yeah yeah it's so weird to me cuz I feel like when I sit when I think of swordfish I just think of like off of Mexico or something I don't think of well it's crazy cuz it gets so because of the Gulf Stream it gets really cold and then it gets really hot once the once the current moves in it's nuts I know don't you think of like the the Marlin the sailfish the sword for all of them to be in like blue crystal clear blue water yeah well I guess it can control our ate yeah they have huge bluefin tuna and stuff too yeah I think the Atlantic's are a lot bigger than the Pacific and also wicked tuna more plentiful I was talking to this he's like a filmmaker director and all that Rick Rosenthal just the other day and he was he dove with the tuna in Nova Scotia oh yeah yeah be cool he said you have no idea like it's scary think about a whale like a whales not moving that fast but look he's like these tuna are 1,100 pounds and they're moving like bull yeah but it and they don't care where you are excuse me coming through no like yeah having fun this one with tuna that's nuts what's wrong with you - that big I'm scared it's literally like bigger than dolphins I mean like yeah oh yeah they're huge they're like bigger than bottlenose dolphin yeah but they're not that huh I guess they were heavier they're not necessarily longer well her head oh they're only weigh like 800 pounds twelve hundred pounds about bottlenose yeah like I always say don't move over thousand yeah Oh rezo's are like 13 13 feet yeah 1,300 no okay oh yeah you got your trivia book there yeah let's look it up and I'm just trying to stump you guys I know the answers oh you do yeah I went to college for this all right page 420 13 feet max on those guys yeah I just don't know I always say over a thousand pounds how many teeth are in it ridges mouth like berries not just bottom just bottom yeah so they're like sperm whales Wow you know what it says their weights are unavailable in this book it's unknown they haven't even weigh - Rizzo four it says their length you know a male could be up to 12 and a half feet a female 12 feet and then the weight says unavailable hey how weird they must need to update this because I know they've been stranded Rizzo's dolphins where they have to have weighed them even in the last few years in Monterey there's been a few Wow I'm surprised you know what you guys we're gonna have to do trivia on the next one yeah sense later some more because to be honest you guys were recording this in the future the way in the past anyways we recorded yesterday's yesterday yeah we only recorded episode 31 yesterday we're trying to get ahead but we're not getting and yeah so should we wrap it up here yeah I think so yeah come whale-watching it's been great come a SAP these hopefully these humpbacks will still be here when you get here I hope so as well all right you guys thanks so much for listening to this podcast if you don't follow us on Instagram it's wale nerds we're seeing a lot of new followers on there actually I noticed a day yeah really cool yeah yes six more followers yeah and thank you to our patreon folks as well we haven't shouted them out for a couple episodes but we do appreciate your support it's something they just added to patreon I got an email two days ago is you can now put group like what photo galleries like an album up which is cool so we're gonna all try to start uploading albums on there from each one of our trips oh cool yeah I didn't even tell you I told Caitlyn yeah that we literally got the email like yesterday okay so yeah thanks for listening you guys hope you all have a great rest of your week and we'll see you on the next one thank you everyone

hello everyone and welcome back to the well Nerds podcast this is episode 33 and we are late as my name is Slater and I'm here with Eric and Caitlyn hey everyone hi and we have something really special planned for this episode that was supposed to be on Monday but we failed and then we went again today and failed yeah I failed several times we're so busy so it's August you know it's the busiest month for well watching in California working 12-hour days looking for whales twelve times fourteen or fifteen did we say there's a new man I'm a new man I've given up whale watching I'm moving on to squirrels i watch them from my balcony yeah we're having new podcasts could be called the squirrel nerds all right crows can we be crow nerds oh my gosh so when I play on my computer like video games with people online the goal is sits out on the roof and it just goes like it does all day and the kids like dude what is that you know like it's a goal you think where the heck do you live that you have a goal moderating but really what we tried to do this afternoon and we got dusted by the Oh Co theaters we tried to go watch see if shadows the documentary we've talked about a couple times in other episodes because they were supposed to be playing this afternoon but for some reason they've got some kind of like private screening thing and their website wasn't updated so that was major bummer but we're gonna try to go before it's done airing next week and then we'll hopefully episode 34 will be our reaction to the documentary but I did enjoy those curry fries we went to eat right next to the Osio theater and Slater definitely enjoy his lunch yeah so but I do have a sneak preview of the documentary because I ran into Maris sidon Stucker who's one of the founders have saved the whales at the grocery store I ran into her and she was going it was the day of the or the day before it was gonna premiere I had a day off and tell me me secrets what just spoilers everyone I'm not going to tell you what happens I'm gonna tell you where the footage is from so they do have footage from operation CPR in the documentary she said she thinks it's at the end cuz she was gonna step out early so she didn't watch it people who know know already what's going to ask she was scared to watch like she thought she was gonna lose it wow people know just that no one wants to actually I don't think many people have seen it I think the operation CPR yeah yeah yeah did you hear how it turned out and why they stopped no I don't know they were given a killed one okay they killed a vaquita well they think maybe to bother let one go know the stress of corralling the animal and putting it through all the health tests and putting it in the c-pen one died and then the other one that they caught they there they showed such poor health signs and so much stress that they let it go with the odds of it surviving we're not very good so he may have actually killed two so now we're down now my my I was gonna make it guess that there were seven five there might be a pretty realistic number unfortunately yeah yeah yeah so we'll let you know how the film goes hopefully we can watch it we don't get maybe we can go Monday as as you said and then record yeah my wife late you will have a late night Monday night sure and watch it another thing is I we're watching today they did are you all with me yeah well watching but not with us yeah I was in Moss Landing cool people zero tabs I like going out expose me and Kaylee went out with discovery well watch today and saw ten plus humpbacks 15 and now open seal good looks at it elephant seal yeah you ever seen one Eric yes I have seen an elephant seal multiple times are you sure that one Oh which one you see was a friend its it's still gonna be there when we get there tomorrow it was a girl I'll go in tomorrow it is you think the elephant seals I promise I'll be there when you get I guess they saw another one the deckhand was like dude yeah and then the Chewbacca said they saw one as well so they might have been three yeah they're coming back they'd hang out they didn't they just leave the beach from molting and they're going back out to see you until the winter around that time yeah they'd run back out off shore yeah such a lanky schedule yeah but flew the drone so it's warm and it's calm it's actually hot on land but out on the ocean it's warm and it's yeah it's like a shirt weather in the Monterey Bay you know it's nice beautiful but the water is greener than a turkey and then in the harbor we're having a red tide don't go swimming if you're in Monterey like turkeys aren't green some of their feathers are your doesn't know but it's pretty uh what is it gorgeous white oak Lincoln Ridge there's lots of plankton in the water right now visibility's poor the northern part of a lot I went out of Santa Cruz the mess around the every day and it was jelly land over there lot of metals casually went out sea spirit on Monday yo use Instagram yeah went to go visit our buddies up there the new company in Santa Cruz I saw a sea lion eat a thresher yes are you paying I saw some jazz and lumpy no let's call it blue lumpy blues lumpy no you can't name all these calves yes Yuri good chunky chunky derogatory I like update for the California Oregon coast whatever whatever when we get there anyways I like calling it lumpy so I'm calling it lumpy it's rude I'm pretty changes also where's my chunky baby bin for like the last week probably hiding as you call it chunky that's like calling it fatty that's rude oh no I'm calling it chunky cuz there's a chunk missing out of it that's still it's calling it this big way too dumb name that's like saying calling me like why thighs or something hey hey big nose hey receding hairline mean to call it chunky why cause if you don't facing out of your back wouldn't you do something chunked out here back Oh back to a trifle that's why I even put the journal for the first place because I wanted to take a picture he when he got hit by a boat big propeller scars like 14 inches across no no they're old like he's so healed like this happened like 20 years like the lines are like 14 inches across and like four feet are smooth and dark yeah no this is a different one than the one around if this is way bigger scars further down on the side hopefully it's still out there tomorrow maybe when we get there he'll be there dude it was gnarly I tried I didn't even get a picture of him and then he flipped and I turned away because I was like I wish you a fluke and then he flukes like you know how they go under then they throw it up weird yeah and the left corner of the fluke is missing too so you might think it actually meant partnership some point something big way bigger than a whale watch boat probably even bigger than a person er mmm maybe not but something like bigger than a breadbox what Sam and how those drives around one owners chinook salmon yes you know I was insane one Hans I was like yeah we get shouldn't examined ever like that is king salmon no like damn it have you guys had any more nicknames of just that oh yeah have you got native ones too well yeah if you guys had a lot of moles in your way the last few days yeah big yeah they're like a slalom out there one we went by it like really close we didn't even see it luckily it went on the side of the boat cuz that thing gonna broke the propeller its head was like I don't know 16 or 18 inches across on the head I know and I got a dog's logs we're like do they have to dodge motor I see yeah we've dodged these big old like garbage can lid sighs Imola no this one was like the size of a car hood its head was 18 inches yeah it's um that big out there like bigger than your windows later cuz they clearly see that on the podcast I have the biggest window ever there has this huge window it's like no but six feet long okay Larry I'm story but the garage door yeah I did but not here I think those are like this that other rare species the one that washed up in Santa this one was mullet Ekta I think there's mola mola mola Tector mola Ram ji yeah which one's the bigger one one of them but they can get pretty big but the shape is different the body shapes different those color colors yeah the colors different but yeah me and rod we're trying to blend that it was like less rod right rod no not like right to it yeah like slalom we were literally swimming one and then pointing to it a couple years ago this captain up in Santa Cruz is like dude I swerved to miss one and I hit two yeah if anyone knows about molas let us know because it seems they're all the same size they're all big ones out here they're hanging out in like fours sometimes I'm just wondering it's a spawning thing or what I think they just followed in the current with the food because they're technically the biggest species of plankton but big sea nettles are like big sea nettles big molas yeah but in like a month - don't we search the little ones in a row yeah fall in the fall like September October remember we walked together in the harbor oh yeah the harbour office and we saw the little one swimming back and forth if anyone knows any mole additions or mole or halogen et's she took a picture of my mullet tattoo on my leg and was like I'm putting this in a textbook so my legs gonna be famous just saying if there's a mole a textbook yeah she's almost done with it so she's a mola Titian yeah and she said she's doing molas in popular culture that's why I should take a picture of my leg she's like I can't believe you have a mullet tattoo trendy let's say we booked a trip to and I'm all those are gonna be like avocado toast the mole a mole is in Antarctica yeah all right I mean see now we need that's why we need to talk to him all Egyptian really on the fence about it but now that you said that there ain't no hard to come ready okay be like Mormon okay remember they're freaking out when they were showing up in Washington no I think I want to see at our is a southern elephant seal that's all you want to see yeah I just wanted to come if you don't want to see yeah I want to see penguins in the leopard seal excuse me sir crabeater seals and I want to see how peckwell's in ice okay she's not Simba you push her off someplace he's playing Lion King on my legs right now it's fine let her go yeah no I really want to go there and see oh I forgot about the leopard seals man I want to see him leopard seal but like from a safe distance like at least you want to eat a penguin probably a sicko oh yeah that to you blood and guts would be okay but like from 200 yards away cuz like I'm not trying to get close to a leopard seal that's scary mm-hm what I will swim with that thing what cuidado about Paul okay Paul Nick Lee what she's been here in Monterey like for two weeks now I think he's staying till the second week September so that's fun I'm sorry about humpback whales there's plenty of him around to film so Paul night Glenn if you listen to this I commented to your thing he didn't come back hey he likes my comment but didn't respond that's a bummer did you know it maybe that's a bummer for you he's intimidated even she should i do since he follows me on Instagram I don't think his assistant because there's no way he's out shooting photos of whales right now I'm posting about his book and his story why not you just not dude I would be he might be though cuz he is taking videos of people on his boat and chef yeah whatever Paul Nathan don't respond it's cool if you could just like reply to my friends but you know it was foggy all week when he was here hmm but it would clear up in the middle of the day they got some great footage dude pleasure down on the Monterey and of things like even when it was five hundred thousand dollar camera yeah this I'm sure they got some nice shots with that Cineflex camera yeah and they're shooting in a case oh yeah I think they're gonna be fog was crazy it came from a mile away drop into like 1080 and it would be so be so sharp oh yeah you could still just shoot it off speed Oh have you had did you guys have people freaked out because of the fog have you had to tell me we smell for whales and listen to him or do that ya know we smelled whales one Dave Matt looked at me like he's like are you part bloodhound I was like I smell like gas outboard motor and I smell a whale and he was like what I was like slow down dude we're almost there what a turducken it was cool though one day the fog lifted and we could just see these it was like still that eerie gray shiny like creepy lighting that's actually when I came up right on the edge of the fog oh so cool it was not shot - the day was shot and uh thanks probably three years ago I just found it oh really yeah maybe use it as the thumbnail or something later yeah something scary like it just like a fluke in the fog now I posted some nice ooh no I have a cooler one cuz it's even brighter nice whatever so so well watching been fabulous fabulous but all that fog has been it's likely it's gone but that fog yeah so you get passengers or like want to reschedule they really freak out don't worry oh yeah got it we got it and honestly that's the cool thing about Monterey for two reasons one there's enough whales around you're gonna trip over them in the fog and to the boats all work together on the water like even though they're competitive at the dock like there's been several days where the captains have like texted each other or said to each other afterwards like good thing we work together otherwise we'd all be screwed or exchange sightings for chips you know what we got a special delivery at the pier nice it was pretty good I pulled up in the boat and brought him over but yeah it's been a really good humpback whale action we had three blue whales yesterday pack three yeah we were watching him for a while and then at some point the boats were starting to ping pong around and we're like no no wait there's got to be more than one and then we got those three what else did you get in the afternoon oh they were they were not very good though that's like all Kaitlyn last night for something completely different and she goes hey we had three killer whales I'm like Tami I'm like I said well that's not what I called you about so they showed that no dude it was so bad I don't know if the companies that pass the siding off to us got better looks than we did but we just went on a report of them like 20 minutes kind of stale so like they're like we're coming in do you get here's the numbers we left him at they're going really fast as a south so we kind of like angled to intercept them and we did get them for two surfacing and they thought there was four we only ever saw three but they were so squirrely that you couldn't even really get good looks at him I think there was one male and then two female types hmm but there was so many humpbacks around we couldn't even get to the killer whales it was like two killer whales came up and there was a humpback on each side to them and there was a humpback between the boat and them and then there was another killer whale and then another humpback on the other side and so it was just like it was whale soup and so we couldn't keep track of the killer whales very good that's cool and yeah I mean what a problem to have tried to weed through and like line up better for the next surfacing and we just barely saw him like still going straight south and another boat came to try and help us and they got one distant look at him again and then they just disappear they were outside a bay right more towards oh yeah we were we picked up on them at like Seal Rock mm-hmm but like out at the edge of the canyon but that far south and we lost them at about Cyprus point maybe I kept going south I look tomorrow hopefully they'll be there when I can't wait south this morning just to see you know what was going on and we saw a lots of humpbacks but no killer whales I really hope the humpbacks don't listen to our podcast why you know we're talking about them cuz they're gonna be like dude all you say is like over everywhere wherever we're gonna leave like we're individuals okay we matter now they're gonna they're just gonna they're anybody go you're passing us you go see a blue whale and then okay fine whatever I just won't come back just act like you take us for granted like we're just gonna stay in Mexico or Hawaii around that'd be sad we'd have to move yeah I would be a bummer there was krill at the surface yesterday when we were watching the blue whales I was really hoping they would feed near the surface I haven't x-ray like the clouds occur on the surface we have like a football-field-sized cloud of krill yesterday morning hopefully when we go out tomorrow they'll still be there when I get there it wasn't there today so I don't know I went through the same area there was a lot of faller ups is everything yeah but we saw like a big red patch of krill at the surface yesterday morning Oh yesterday yeah we had a black-footed albatross every day actually the last few days in the morning I've been water play for days there how do you trying to fill you in I thought a lot and one thing about like these I saw one day it's true it's pretty awesome just saying we've seen some storm petrels absolutely Wow I saw a black bear today yeah yeah oh I saw squid at the surface the other day we were out watching Rizzo's and I looked at the calf and I was like do you see squid on the meter and he was like it kind of I was like I'm pretty sure I just saw ones it mark it's late mark it's a little one yeah I would like to see me return up to Humboldt yeah I know he saw a little squid on the meter you know a lot of it I know yeah now just so he it's like are you happy - looking for him one boat saw a big piece of what they think is Amaro two--this whoa and did they retrieve it no yeah last time I saw season I was not allowed to retrieve it they took pics well they were asked to retrieve it but they like let it go before they were asked oh yeah more to fish thanks that you ding-ding kind of like a humble but like more Barb's right what's it is that club hook is that the common name for I think second might be club hook for the common name squid nerds help us out here here a cephalopod nerd sea slug man I learned that word cephalopod like they're watching watching aquanauts no on the fishing boat Bubble Guppies what Bubble Guppies I don't know I just know these kid shows because they like showed up at the aquarium to promote themselves oh this is a new thing go nuts Octonauts yeah there's a bubble guppy but they're most of the shows are pretty true like they give out pretty good information that's good yeah like when I was a kid Steve Irwin Crocodile Hunter when you're a kid the Jeff Corwin experience thing you're probably in like high school in that dang dude I grew up on crocodile all right okay I'm so old that one of the first wildlife shows I remember watching a lot that you guys have no clue I'm talking about it's called like mutual I was sponsored by other campaign yeah but like the original version I was like this like older white haired guy just like well and they show footage of animals and that was it well there's always only Californians are gonna know him music you know no yeah he's only California was only on like public TV like went to each place yeah this is the Niagara Falls and this is yeah he's really cool he's kind of my idol he's basically a guy yeah he would travel all around California show you weird historic places like really random ones and he was like really like a funny guy he's at this guy but he'd be like ever seen what about super famous later hit me with this fact when he was going to Baja this is a boo-boo food did you ever watch that yeah it's a lemur I think I saw I've know that when I saw the cover I was like aw man I remember seeing that but no I did I watched that my nephews watch today that's why I know yeah the Kratt brothers I watched it yeah man it was all unlike Discovery Channel and Animal Planet Jacques Cousteau like oh gee original Cousteau you guys only know why my time the kids jean-michel Jarre michelle whoa wait wasn't he nevermind I'm not gonna say anything he's got a record for those of you probably know me really well you're probably I'm gonna bring up not gonna bring it up just asked us about it later on good boy yeah nothing well tell you later when you're older okay I'm hungry wish you had a piece of great way oh oh okay so anyways I do have some interesting news about humpback whales from this week did you see Bob Perry's post about Santa Barbara channel yesterday yeah what the humpback mom and the dead calf yeah yeah they don't know I don't think they could see anywhere on the calf where it was like how it died right but the mom was like holding the guy I just heard about it holding it the grieving process yeah yeah in Santa Barbara on a condor express where's Adam we need them yeah Adam you need to go home already a document that said can you be on our podcast when he comes back in September oh my god yeah he has two guest appearances your mom delivery for me yeah hey bring me some snacks and we'll talk there's a San Juan snacks they can get this next year they do you know you bribe me with roses lavender chocolate no offense lavender farm a lot of people probably after you no I'm kidding dude I'm not kidding dude having a chopper was like I tried the dark chocolate in like nasty yikes don't bring me that then Adam bring me some other snacks I'm probably the first person who's been bit by a dog during a podcast what about you not on purpose is my father she stuck the ball in her mouth that's wrong Lacey's really hyper for today napping like well nerd mark-ass i have rabies okay so then my other humpback whale news which I just saw today is out of I think maybe Waldport in Oregon your homeland a juvenile humpback whale washed up in there to euthanize it on the beach cuz they watch my wife yeah wash up live but they couldn't refloat it so they ended up euthanizing it so much sad yeah what a bummer yeah they said 20 foot long so I had to have been a calf from this year yeah that's a yeah so we shall see what happens also this guy I'm friends with who's a seabird leader Alvaro he said that he's been watching reports from NOAA they think that the blob is working its way back in Shore they're seeing signs of it up in Alaska and they think by the fall it'll be down in California what did you guys see that video of all the dead salmon in Alaska yes and they were like oh like the warm water killed them all that was actually where they weren't they just there to spawn come here it was like so they were the same as wrap them and whatever happened the neck broke or whatever they all killed them all yeah they did but everybody used it as like which climate change I'm not saying it is real what yeah but I'm saying they some people were saying like oh it's because the warm water and nothing to do with the water although that's not helping but I guess the net or something broke or something happened but they all died that happened in 2015 with anchovies Paul Nicklin got that really compelling photo of all the dead and Jovi's at sunrise and people see it the wrong way no one puts a bad caption on there yeah I mean he did put the caption correctly that a sinner wrapped him and probably the fish were the wrong size so they let them go there's that bycatch but after you wrap them they're dead some of their scales they're pretty much and also if they get too much bycatch just think sometimes it is drop yeah sometimes if the catch isn't clean enough if it's full of jellyfish or follows other stuff they don't know that's why you guys got to do your research when you see photos like that yeah to be surprising just kind of like you November the El Nino weather pattern how they show the warm water coming this way there are people who are ecaptions saying this is the radiation from Fukushima temperature in fact they actually some places just stop showing you know certain aquariums that stop showing it these people in their head saw that coming this way and they're like no that's just warm water it's not radiation you know so that's my well news for the week oh you guys Adam Ernst turns on his way to the residence so the residence okay cameras winding earlier on it's yeah please in my office in the residence there now he's headed out there you know our buddies are posting it so I was like there's been three births and three deaths is that what's going on there yeah did they it's so weird though because when I was at the last time they were saying like they they they said normally they would see those members like it's easy for them to like spot him mm-hmm and they didn't see them but they like didn't confirm it and then then they just like release that paper well they must have gone through all the photos from all the encounters and they really didn't see those whales yeah crazy that must be how they determine it right Eric don't you think they go through all the photos and they're like hope they're not here yeah they're so highly monitored that they everyone knows everyone literally knows the man knows who they are and watches them that you know they know if something's gone for a while something bad has happened yeah the three young ones are still alive but the three older ones are not yeah that's too bad so that what are they at what number 73 yeah I think so okay so depressing northern right well news - did you see the report release from Center for coastal studies for the partial doesn't dingleman they did two weeks ago no what happened oh my god the photos there's like plates of baleen sticking out of this poor whales mouth because it was wrapped up so badly and they don't even think they got all the gear off it like they tried to make as many crucial because it will yeah they get so tangled I know cuz they're all mouth entanglements because their skin feeders and they're so yeah and then there's so many have you ever seen have ever showed you photos of how dense the pots are it's insane they're like 20 feet from each other oh geez hundreds of them spaced like that it's just nuts damn yeah and they're in a daisy chain - usually what are the pots for lobster and blue crab where's it I mean yeah they fish the whole eastern seaboard for it and up into Canada so yeah it's a bummer and it's shallow for like a long ways out there so they can fish pot inline fisheries like through the whole whales habitat because it's just like 150 feet the whole way you know kind of like when you're out going out to the Farallones for 25 miles it's one depth we've had a few entanglements out here right since we last recorded I think I had the last episode I had yeah what's funny is I was going through well flukes for ID for those and then came across a will with lines on it notice it till I dropped the photo but they said it looks like really thin like it might even be monofilament oh really yeah how many days ago this was like last week but Dara where no buoys just thin line yeah just in line but I cropped it in pretty much and they say that from the diameter it might be mono yeah yeah oh that's a bummer yeah I've seen whales in our area with gill nets on him before too which is pretty wild cuz like no one uses him not this year it's like four seasons ago but yeah interesting yep well well it's hot here man we still seeing so many whales I know now is a great time to come well watching your weather looks gorgeous tomorrow for tomorrow October yeah you coming October 1st leadership what is it again plugging my trip what day is it though 11th 11th October 11 yeah it's the only reason why it's gonna be awesome is because we're ending on sunset we're starting a bit later than last time I think we start walrus I think you're leaving at 9:00

gonna freak out there's too many places to go and not enough money to fly me there yeah pick up pick up well destination first later he needs to travel bad where should he go uh tax like Santa Barbara thing real quick cuz I just saw another update from oh yeah they found the carcass today with no mom no mom yeah no snows obvious signs of the cause of death that's a carcass well if it's upside down what if I vote well when they usually float upside down because the gas fills in their throat pouch and they put the body over see the dog yeah this oh I see we're saying if it was hit on the back yeah yeah I don't know if it floats in I guess they could mean crops yet but we may never get an answer cuz I don't know how far out it is Thanks yeah bummer I said especially in that area that's a high-traffic area yeah I wondered right but it doesn't look obvious but again like Slater said it could be on the back or like its head could be crushed and you have no idea Wow happy thanks what could happen the ship strike ones that I've seen like on the beach in Monterey um like their skull is fractured when they need crops yet mm-hmm I think I don't think those bones are and they're cracked it's crazy and horrible yeah blue last year had actual damage on the cap we would really have I don't know washing up we were going to any we should go to another one extant happened the last one I heard it was the beaked whale yeah and that was like on the down-low did was he beat bill I want to see a live beaked well it rates you when we were out on that to the candy in the last few days I've been looking real hard cuz we're like late summers good time to see him I feel like I've seen him in september/october a lot well where do you think in the world would be the best place for people to get a chance to see beaked whale those oars well yeah a sorcerers it worries whatever there's all right I don't know I'm just asking I don't know ask Joe he's from there I really have worked there too oh I'll ask someone that's actually from work as always I think it's already but yeah that's like one of the best places in the world to see because ants are miles boo other than Dominica Dominique is a good place you know where they've been doing because like someone has a permit there something you get Dominica they have a sperm whale swimming permit three places have it they've come up with a lot of that good Rizzo dolphin ecology yes they must have a lot of squid there think of all the species yeah Rizzo's dude you really well sperm whales and because on both sides why not early for us stop being selfish that's right everyone how'd they get there bro India bro pan G is not real whether there's humpbacks on North America to stop putting them in charge great whales in Italy they belong in the ocean you guys are driving him around did I wish I could have seen Pangaea would have been doe me so much my stuff I'm going here he goes Slater needs a flux capacitor per hour you got to keep making a flux capacitor Hey in the freakin mechanic shop by captain's sophiar yesterday let's put a flux capacitor like it takes later back to Pangaea Eric why are you standing up in podcasting cuz he can does anyone like this we're different we're different but I'm a huge eeeh no I'm not heated well I'm actually he because it's just hot here in Monterey which is weird what have I winter so here's our neighborhood screaming yeah so here's screaming kids in the background oh I do have another humpback whale news thing is it depressing no it's a cool one okay um so dave cage no one communicated in the goldberg in lab defended his thesis successfully on wednesday and I got the Cliff Notes version of his talk during via text because I was on the boat so he was talking about well Roarke well whale feeding and being large body size is relatively new geologically speaking only within the last eight million years really cool new the Earth's like 4.2 billion years old or something Linda I'm not done this schooling behavior of fish is way older like pre dinosaur that behavior so what's happening yeah the schooling behavior of in small fish is so old that they have not evolved a better escape mechanism from large whales because like when I explained it on the boat I'm like okay when sea lions are humpbacks are feeding together they take advantage of the to escape methods of the anchovies the schooling and the scattering so the schooling behavior is so old that the fish have not figured out how to get away from a predator better because having an animal that can eat the whole school at once is new geologically speaking this is some deep thinking here dude this is cool I was like mom I need to sit back down to think about you need think about it I know this is think this is not just not just let this marinate well nerdy ology nerd news - wait let me ask you a question what if the fish are older they should be wiser duh no dude that's like one of those in eight behaviors that's like born into a fish's brain school to school swim into school well they need to figure it out because they're getting eaten by this I do they've had 8 million years to figured out not only by the whales but by the humans like they're getting wrapped up that's why schools saying waiting to tell us that joke for like years that's why talking about fish he said when we talk about you guys he's not even into whales when he start talking about fish he gets so excited he is part fish my last name it means fish but also you have the thing he does yeah here's the ocular I swear if I last name ye and it isn't officially I'm even the Pisces you are yeah wait but you'd rather be a very high seas you're right on the border like right at the end no I'm not an astro Titian Ares I meant to say ye means it says yee-ha that's cool I guess they live streamed it somewhere I don't know if it's on youtubes maybe yeah I don't know where I'd like to watch it doesn't really gets be landing well sometimes put up students and PhD presentations but I'm not sure about Hopkins but he's already come up with good stuff I go we always go to lectures he talks and he talks about the efficiency the mouth capacity yeah the lunch feeding all kinds of stuff in the inaudible operation with the sea lion so he's come up with a lot of the good stuff already I can't wait to see what he does next yeah we were handing him off a lot of blue blue well numbers to the last few last few years he's been working I don't see anywhere in this disorder or dictionary that yi means fish yeah it's not gonna look up the original Chinese names you need like a Chinese area or something I don't know Chinese what call my dad he'll tell you dad he does not Chinese Oh was a zoom broadcast I don't think you can watch it after the fact it was like a video conference mmm so what they would support to defend these humpbacks or what Oh God Slater he's not just say that what no they don't go to court to defend oh no not that kind of defense judge judy was there to defend backs they just only know school oh he's I thought he really meant like defend when we said defend it was defending no no but not to who was saying that that's not true someone even saying it's not true no when you defend your thesis you have to prove all the work that you've done for your PhD is like worthy of you getting your degree so you have to go defend it to your Board of advice but you'll be surprised there will be either a very mean professor who might tell you it's not true right after that or made later on they might come and talk to you yeah they want to embarrass you oh yeah they'll tell you right there yeah like a whole piano dude well that deliberate whether you're worth getting your PhD yeah go to a nerd convention like that someone is standing up in the crowd they're like oh really but how do you know when you didn't sometimes sometimes but sometimes it's a pleasant way or they'll actually to help you but some ways it's like whoa you're mean and I'm gonna go cry now yeah seven years on this yeah oh my god just throw in the towel now I've been working on this for six years it's got I remember being in school it got so awkward like I would walk out at some of my homes are gonna fight it's like two years at work like I've never I've never been to very many that word like gonna be highly contested but I've been to a few where they like really just like blatantly asked a question you're like wow yeah you're like oh really oh really why don't you come out here for six years trying to put freaking camera tags on a home really humpback swim because they actually fly underwater have you seen their wings sure Dave did successfully defend so he got his PhD good for him go Dave he's a fellow Oregon State Alumni just saying Oregon Oregon um Nevada so I'm proud of him and he's I'm thinking is gonna do some cool stuff gold bogan you and I think that guy know someone else or re re Friedlander there there they want to use some of my footage and not them but the company that's doing a story on them Oh cause II remember I told you that oh yeah yeah yeah I hope to be a guy from Hopkins yeah yeah cool Dave works with them a lot too so he's probably in there somewhere as well I know what they're doing it on on blue whales I think or something what photos do they ask you for the blue information whoa all right I'll just leave early because I don't know but the blue or a humpback I forgot but I know I sent it over Joan yeah that's cool no those guys do some really nice like really they get really good footage but they also have an excellent way of presenting it let us say something else what so the TV show Jeopardy reached out to me about some plenty yeah maybe I just want to see the species that they want but isn't that be kind of cool yes yeah that's gonna use your staff later so just give me on they're gonna be like what is this mola mola I choose peak to fish for 9,000 Alex I will take fish for thousand yeah I think it's 200 you know but they owned them all is that yeah then they're on like back-to-back on this TV time slots it's like one than the other oh is it yeah my grandma used to watch them see I know that cuz my grandma was no laughs and no one picks your question do they have to go do the whole thing to play the whole board it's got to be like a Daily Double or something no that's cool Oh cuz as a video there's only time they do it is for the Daily Double baby so all I know is they asked me they said are you sure that this is the animal because our marine biologist said it's a little small and I was like I'm pretty sure that this is the animal you're like I want to talk to your mom thank you excuse me um I've worked with a whole bunch of marine biology look I probably know your I'll just if he really is a marine but no actually I think they have to just be sure they can't mess up like they can't trust anyone I would be embarrassing yeah one time someone spoke at a conference at Murray mammalogy conference in San Francisco 2015 and they were not a whale person I can't remember how they got asked to speak but they put up a photo of a gray whale and they said it was a humpback whale and everyone audience lost it I know did they like what so funny she's like really I put it in Google and we lost our laughing even harder yeah I read on Wikipedia that that happens a lot oh well yeah for sure but um it was just funny cuz it's like you're presenting to the world experts there's even more famous artists out there that will add like you know oh the dorsal fin on this gray whale - true yeah and then they keep on drawing it everywhere yeah oh yeah if you guys live in Long Beach look at the conventions there look at look at the round part and look at the gray whales so if you're certain calculate for that what remember Long Beach the gray whales and the convention center they have dorsal fins someone added dorsal fins to them oh really yeah need to take a photo of that damn it - the whale nerds Instagram don't want to see it I thought I showed you know yeah when I went to the Fresno fishing show I actually wait while and painted dorsal fins although he said his name we just lost a listener oh I don't know why I'm like I'm learning from wolves from these guys that's you painted it yeah oh my gosh so you'll be surprised - who will make mistakes whatever it while it doesn't listen to our podcast not anymore hey you know what I probably wrote a caption that's about the wrong way or something before anyway so could happen never know totally could happen all right well we're going to try and watch these shadows before it goes out of theaters in our area if it's playing at a theater near you because I know they're trying to play them all across the u.s. now you should go check it out it's technically an eco thriller it looks like it's an hour and 20 minutes it's not gonna be that scary well it is scary but like it's real life it hurts your heart scary not like scary movies it's a thriller I don't like thrillers anything with a thriller to do with scary movie um no it's suspenseful and it's traumatic and it's you know it's in 3d no yes in 3d the vaquita is gonna come out slap yet is there an seen there's like Thanos kind of I'm just kidding oh good no so yeah so definitely try try and watch it we're gonna try and watch it and we'll let you know what what it's like in episode 34 hopefully and keep sending us topics as well if you watch it all right don't give it away and we're seriously so sorry you guys we're all like just cannot we just can't get a time together cuz we can't talk about which I'm always available and they're never available so like I mean I might

be giving attention to our guests on the boat can't be podcast hello everybody welcome back to the Willard's podcast we are alive on the ocean hold on I gotta find the drone now we'll get it together next few weeks of the busiest weeks and then we're back to pound of normal routine so not too much longer thanks for sticking with us thank you everyone and do you see make sure it falls on Instagram no follow us that whale nerds on Instagram yeah we're almost a thousand followers or like nine something and I was gonna see something else but I forgot 94 Slater's all day trips I don't actually don't want you guys to come on that no no no something else is important Oh sense later trivia questions oh we're just later go for vacation yeah that too hi give up you guys but we'll hit you on the next episode thank you guys so much for listening we'll try to be on time next week maybe thank you bye everyone thank you for listening

-

hello everyone and welcome back to the well Nerds podcast this is episode number 34 my name is Slater and I'm here with Eric and Caitlyn hi everyone and we are gonna be on time if it's going by the day Monday but not by the time of upload will be twelve hours behind okay 13 hours bond yeah what time do we do what normally haven't come out at like 6:00 a.m. early in the morning yeah so we're 12 hours p.m. right now we're in the future but you guys will get it what future always in the future dude anyways we actually have a topic this week which is also exciting news should we talk about that first or should we talk about like our sightings were sightings it's not about sightings I did go whale watching one time for the one time for the one time no I went I went like almost every other day two days in a room yeah I'm gonna roll actually you went three days in a row yeah oh yeah cuz I thought my friend came so then yeah I went again wow what a week all right so I saw humpback whales that's it dudes don't know dolphins Rizzo's no no the other day we were like too far to the west to go back to the Rizzo's bummer so I saw humpbacks we did have a humpback do some tail throws I got the drone up for a second but he kind kind of stopped tail slapping right when I got over it water was so green so green more green than a green machine what the heck like the juice you know the naked juice green machine oh yeah a little plastic bottle yeah yeah smoothies out of plastic bottles I'd say okay that starts from my less ever had one was like she doesn't forward now you just have to buy the four nine any middle school drink yeah [Laughter] but hey doesn't John Rogers come in like styrofoam cups yeah it does John juice it up did I know that jamba used to I think it's plastic now anyways you should take your own cup with you if you're gonna go to a place like that you need to do that you think you think I'm coming in drama do so I might fill this out yeah especially in Monterrey now cuz they're yeah the cities are like all Monterey County and Santa Cruz County several cities are trying to ban all single-use plastic hey someone went to even went to a boat one of my friends and me go to a boba place the other day and they were willing to fill her her own yeah she brought popcorn bowl fill it for you no I think that's a little too weird I gotta look like a cup whatever they don't know that excuse me sir this is popcorn on the side of it like you cannot put a smoothie in it okay I forgot to tell you guys about siding last week for episode 33 that was actually pretty cool so what happened was we were watching humpback whales and then the boat said there's a built further to the west of us and it was like oh we have Rizzo's dolphins and then the Rizzo's kept coming in coming in coming in and they just stayed around the humpbacks and the sea lions feeding for like two and a half hours that's crazy and they were like diving with the whales and the sea lions and disappearing like I don't know if there was squid and everything was eating the fish the squid and the krill or what but like the Rizzo's just stayed with it the whole time mm-hmm that's awesome azar I know it cool I know I have a video in the shop at Discovery that has the humpbacks and Rizzo swim any other yeah they're just swimming this is like they like feeding hmm that's interesting they were like all the same dive easy yes dude the humpbacks are going up squids that kid I mean has anyone ever documented that how you gonna know if like say the squid oh the anchovies on the same layer and they're just like oops I've actually seen squid eat encho bees and then everything is together eat yeah yeah Sina don't ever know I've never seen all the foods together I've seen like anchovies eating pearl and then the ang of the squid came to eat the anchovies and then mackerel we're coming into you the anchovies and then humpbacks with everything there happen out of ya we don't know candy and a few years ago that's like a straight-up buffet for Finn well yeah crow and chose mackerel yeah yeah I mean I've seen humpbacks eat anchovies and the anchovies were eating krill yeah and the humpback just ate it all so much variety I mean yeah I thought it was really cool I'd never seen the Rizzo's like act like they were foraging so awesome you guys had another cool sighting did you see him as well Eric just Kate you Kailyn the killer whales Oh aye I'm the only one that saw it yeah I was in the middle of the bay so what day was that you know Thursday or Friday since I wasn't there my Friday yeah Thursday Friday I don't remember but um our other bill went out ahead of us and we were kind of like lagging behind trying to search a different area and they were like oh we found killer whales and the night before that we had seen killer whales briefly we got like really bad looks at him I don't know if it was the same group or not but it was a group of whales that it was seven total there was two calves in the group was all female types and somebody said that it might be ca 155 I looked at the catalogue and thought maybe 154 was in there as well but one of the calves is so little it was light gray and it still had fetal folds so these are pretty super ultra rare yeah way rarer than atoms super ultra make it more rare than atoms super ultra I've never seen the 155 s before ever yeah we've kept on going back to carmella ban nothing's been out there and I was thinking when you left him they were northbound yeah they were northbound West Point I was hoping his eyes in the fog I was hoping he would still be there when I get there ya know I don't know man because we like we're watching him watching him they started to group up and travel I was like okay this might get pretty easy and then WHAM the fog bank came and I was like no I wish you guys could see Eric's face every time he says this will they still be there when I get there cuz he looks around like he he's hoping that he's gonna trip one of us up but at this point we're so used to it we just keep going I don't think 99% of our listeners have no clue why I say that do you think I had to meet me in person let's tell them someone on the radio one day asked if the whales were still more than once yeah with the whales were still gonna be breaching with when they got there this person is a Audrey there's no way to tell if I was gonna be doing anything for longer than and this person is very well-known they are I'm marine biologist and they they want to make sure you know they're a marine biologists and they ask questions like that on a regular basis yes so anyway so my super mega ultra rare rarer than Adams killer whales was pretty cool the little baby was so tiny and had such big eye patches oh that's funny that it was kind of grayish - yeah it was really great actually when we first watched them I was like these are not California transient it's like I have no idea who these whales are and the captain was like well what do you think and I said I texted you I was like can you send this is someone up in Washington because I don't think these are our whales and it turns out they are Californian documented California whales but they're not very commonly sighted it's so weird when you see killer whales like here it's it's like and if it's not like Emma or the 5151 days or you know someone that we see you like immediately are like dang these are like different whales mm-hmm and their behavior is kind of different yeah they were yeah they were kind of different they definitely are transient though cuz it killed something that had like the albatross coming in I noticed those last groups of transients that worked our usuals we're really shallow water like literally right outside the surf line I bet you if they come from up north where there they go into shallow water all the time because there's a lot of shallow water spots enough fact that one day those those T's yeah really close they were literally in front of Santa Cruz Harbor oh yeah the one was like 155 C 165 little yellow calf we first spotted them like just kind of right off the 49 yeah really close like the Senate that's my plan yeah cement plant so you know it's weird how they've trended in shallow water and the whores are usually like maybe looking for a purpose yeah they probably did it on purpose to be in shallow water I said looking for harbour porpoise you're saying on porpoise someone asked a question on Instagram uh her name is Sarah and she asked she heard us talking about how we saw humpback do a tail throw one of you saw and you notice that it was pregnant do you want explain why you can tell oh or make a good guess um yeah that was probably a while ago huh yeah so the later in the season so like in another month or month and a half the females you know the baby's getting really big so the females start to look very girthy low in their body so and if they do a tail throw and like you can see a pretty good portion of the lower half of their body it's like their tail stock is like twice the size of a normal whale and so then that's because you can see like their baby bump basically and yeah that sometimes if they get the tail only part of the way up you can't really tell but sometimes they do a good enough tail throw that you're like holy moly that's not a normal like that's not how a humpback great whales - yeah you can't see it on great whales - especially on the drones yeah the drone you could totally tell when one's real wide yeah yeah because gray whales especially like their head is so narrow that like they only get so much wider across the shoulders whereas humpbacks like they have those they get pretty wide around the head already and then like you know kind of stayed pretty consistent down the sides of their body until their tail I don't know they're hungry whales it's more obvious like they look so much pudgy er it's so small so during grey whale migration in Newport I think I've talked about this but I had a gray well go right past the finra or like they passed each other mm-hmm like going opposite ways basically it's like they were migrating a you know away from each other but the fin was really just circling the area for food I wonder how often like the humpbacks or like the gray whales are just like what we're going the same way let's hang out and they just cruise for a few minutes and then yeah I don't think they ever do or they're just always like eh I'm gonna stay like a mile away or hundred I don't think they say that far but I don't know I mean they for sure run into each other yeah like we sometimes like if we have a lot of humpbacks in the winter in Monterey like they'll be right out on the edge of the canyon where the gray whales were migrating and you guys very well skin feeding with the humpbacks this year right yeah we actually had this one gray whale that was with feeding feeding humpbacks I got a picture of it too Yeah right out for the moss but the fleet saw it a few times yeah I mean there's been photos in front of Moss Landing several seasons on the northbound migration of gray whales like in the same feeding group as humpbacks like coming up multiple search yeah I've actually seen a smaller gray actually skim feed right in front of Moss - got some photos of that yeah so you know I think they think but those two especially probably hang out like more than we think and they seen Blues and fins together Wow yeah see pinky's mixed in with feeding humpbacks really yeah awesome I'm a cup of Island mmm yeah I feel like on a day where we've had like a big number of humpbacks in Newport cuz there's been a day where we had like five at one time big day it was crazy down we had like five hops and I remember there being like a Brutus whale in there or like a minke whale yeah yeah when I went out and looked we were looking for say whales in Massachusetts there was humpbacks around that would be sick imagine being out offshore blue water big school anchovies and it's like a minke whale humpback like go just keep going through the bait ball you know what I mean cuz they got to do that their hat it's not been done before for sure or you think they just are like you're you're on that bait ball I leave any out right I mean cuz the dolphin there's did you see that stuff in like blue planet where it's like huh I don't know where there's dolphins coming through it yeah going through it and all soon yeah for the swell shoots right through it thinks all of it at once yeah sign me up what else did you see this week Eric I saw blue well um you know what I never got to the blue whales we just stayed with the a whole bunch of humpbacks I've had a lot of good humpback sightings and Rizzo's had that I think I might have already talked about the one mystery common dolphin that showed up no nowhere yeah yeah so I've had just a typical a whole bunch of humpback whale sightings at the stellar sea lion today do I think anything else what did you guys say that it's been kind of a slower not slower we still have tons of whales but the south wind like really changed the way the food's been acting and so the whales got real quiet when it got when the air pressure changed at that south wind a couple weeks ago there was like 60 yeah start blowing up they're still there it's really scattered it was beautiful off of where I feel Carmel today even spent some time oh we were there yes yeah up north a few weeks a few days ago oh yeah I saw see you on you know thresher shark I talked about that oh yeah kind of cool but pictures yeah things are pretty neat out there good variety did they have a fin right then a fin well this morning yeah I heard fin whales and Whitesides this morning but I was on the boat but they went pretty far out I could you saw me mad with all their sighting reports so I said stop talking and I love you guys on the boat tomorrow ya know I'm in the office well yeah I'm back out in the water as usual cool I'll be there yeah but yeah conditions that are amazing today whenever picked up literally glassy all day yeah nice yep cool yeah should we talk about our movie yes therefore sadness grab a tissue everyone said I don't know I think we're desensitized to the subject at this point if anything I left mad I left incredibly frustrated cuz it wasn't the whole story yeah I know I mean for those who know the whole story or talk to people involved the the rescue yeah it was I was like wait they left that part I have a whisper double this layer is like there's more than two that more than one that died yeah so what I did walk away with was a greater appreciation and level of respect for investigative journalists oh yeah because that guy that the story really centered around didn't tell people what we're talking about oh yeah documentary status which was produced by Nat Geo Wild lens and one other subsidiary what's that yeah Leonardo DiCaprio was involved on the production as well it's a good film honestly it was very good yeah tackles the plight of the vaquita and talks about how did we get into this mess like how did we how how is the illegal trade of the swim bladder of a totally different animal of a fish killing the world's smallest cetacean so till table is like the cocaine of the sea and the swim bladders go on the Chinese market for tens of thousands of dollars and it was like forty five thousand they pay forty five hundred a swim bladder to the fishermen and then on the black market when it gets all the way by the time it's changed hands and all the way into the Chinese dealers and China in China they're selling them for like seventy thousand to the actual paying customer yeah for one swim bladder which I mean that's a great level yeah / like wait it was like worth more than gold yeah so total I was like a sea bass it looks just like honor like yellowfin croaker kinda like yeah a big croaker or a white sea bass and be familiar with that do they only I think they only exists in the north yeah damn big trouble - yeah so if you watched um what is it called song of the Vermillion see apricot Louis there's another documentary that wildlands did as well just themselves a couple years ago that came out in 2017 and that talks about a little more just like background of the whole thing and the same family of fishermen that are featured in see if shadows is featured in song the Vermillion see and they aquaculture Toth wahwah because they tried to flood the market with the fish bladders from smaller fish so that the black-market ones wouldn't be as valuable and it didn't work and so I don't know what they're doing with the aquaculture because in this film they were just trying to fish south in a different area they weren't they didn't talk anything about the fish farm so I don't know yeah so basically there was illegal fishermen and legal fishermen and then the legal fishermen started actually going out there and taking the net yeah of the illegal fishermen so that they would stop killing the vaquita yes so the other component is that Sea Shepherd has been involved now with operation Milagro for two years two and a half years so they're there right now yeah they've been removing gill nets on for the Mexican government because they don't have the resources to do it and they've recruited the help of the legal fishermen to give them something to do because they can't they sit around doing nothing a lot and so they go dragged for the nets and then market for sea shepherd to pull out of the water and then on top of that they at nighttime when the fishermen the illegal fishermen are out there they're spotting these boats on radar and then they're sending their drone up to go and see what they're what the pongas are doing mm-hmm and then if they're pulling up a net they go over there and scare them away and then they call the Navy and they call the Navy and or no they call the Navy and to go after him yeah they pulled up over at the end of the film they let you know they pulled up over eight hundred they've taken over eight hundred gill nets yeah that's crazy yeah think about how many fish each one of those gill nets has taken well do you know when they stopped filming Erik like what where did they cut off the footage I don't know because I know two years ago at the Southern California remember workshop we were watching you know previews and talking to people who were involved with this so it's been a while in production yeah I follow the operation Milagro reports and I feel like about two years ago this either they chose to not include it or it happened afterwards they pulled up a rack of baleen in one of the gill nets and they identified it from a fin whale really so one of those Gill I mean they kill lots of sharks and fish and turtles and vaquita and other types of dolphins but this is a fin whale just the baleen was left the gill had been in the water so long that only the baleen was left in the net yeah oh man when the turtle got pulled up yeah it really tells you all the details about what's going on down there and all the issues is not just you know you you can't just take care of one part of the problem it's a big problem wide spread between cartel you know legal fishermen illegal fishermen local police getting paid off Navy Navy that may be Admiral made my blood boil yeah what was crazy to me is it also to the illegal fishermen were like there's no such thing as vaquita like you guys are crazy I ever I've never seen one so when we went to Penasco me and Sheryl a couple years ago which is one of the mainland side of the Sea of Cortez towns that's a vaquita town our tour guide on like this one he was driving the van he's like my dad's a shrimp fisherman he's always been a shrimp fisherman he's never seen one he says they're not real is ever they're painted on the walls and did you see that in Penasco the facility said Oh which they have that little baby vaquita in the bathtub footage during the movie of the kita washed up live in Penasco one time and this kid's telling me they're not real and then yeah that footage that they got of one is cool to see it oh that was hard imagine seeing that like that could be the last one they could ever film yeah might have already been the last one yeah so we have no idea huh no one knows a current current talk out there is yeah it's in single digits yeah which cuz they left it as there's less than 15 but that wasn't 2018 so it's already here well and they've been there rule of thumb at the Raider decline is like more than one per month it may even be gone you know what's funny is in the film did you see that catch that part where they said that supposedly even at this low number there's enough genetic genetic diversity I think it's leave that with hope true no I don't think maybe when we were talking less than 50 animals yeah okay because what if it's two males left you're done yeah make any sense yeah do you know anything about how the frozen zoo works Oh in San Diego not really but yeah but kita are in there yes so they like take the genetic information of yeah I think it's mu that was as they call it down Sandia Crest or serious something it's that program I don't know it did they take like sperm and egg or do they just take genetic material it's just genetic material what does he guess he can try to put them together yeah just in case technology advances to the point where we could have a Jurassic Park moment yeah yeah I'd say yeah like they call it the frozen zoo so I think they spared no expense in putting it together yeah hopefully one day they can bring these animals back life always I wanna the desmos to come back I want pakicetus I got a lot of questions excuse me this key sit down let's just honestly the only crazy one I know like it's the biggest word I know it's fun talking about pakicetus yeah so I think for me I mean it really did resonate the whole cartel aspect of the whole thing where like you know they're interviewing people that they were blocking out not only their faces but like their tattoos on their hands and their chests and what listening to the the naval Admiral yeah talk to the journalist I was just like you we just realized kidding me we do I just ruined the whole film for people haven't seen it yet we forgot to spoiler alert no but there's some parts that you have to see for yourself but like the lacing in that - I know the oops you could sense the mafia vibes the like paid off government officials vibes it was just yeah maybe not attacking back to the to the fishermen when the fishermen are attacking the police yeah I think that was just cuz they're military forces not the those guys that were responding to the incident were not trained and riot yeah they had but it was also shields and so many I mean it's one thing to have a riot shields is nothing how often do you hear any type of police force say oh we released him due to public pressure yeah they gave up but the fisherman repossessed one of their Navy boats they got on in like I don't think they had to shoot them or anything but they could have done like teargas or just something hold them back they were throwing rocks at police like not rocks boulders sizing guys with automatic rifles they're not shooting and they let them take over this enable ship it took over the Navy ship like yeah so the the public fishermen are just taking over a Navy ship and doing what they want yeah they could have drove it off with it for photos they wanted when I lived in Mexico there's two things that I learned one riots have gone very far awry in Mexico and it's like a major national embarrassment and like they don't you they don't want to do it again basically they don't want to fire on an open crowd as a military force again which I understand but to we talked we had like a debate a fake debate to practice our language skills in class about gun control I was like well this is a really interesting fake debate topic but basically the teacher was like most people in Mexico don't carry a gun because like the police know that the people that do carry guns they have better ones than the police like oh that's terrifying yeah that's crazy rules over there so but overall yeah that was it's really it was a pretty good film the one weird part is those of us who know yeah there was two animals caught but they only talked about one I wonder why they left that out I'm wondering how much of it is at the behest of Noah so there's also not a lot of talk about the US government's involvement in operation vaquita CPR yeah they talk a lot with the vet one of the vets that they brought in from the US since the doctor Cynthia Smith yeah and then they briefly talked about Lorenzo who's one of the main researchers from Mexico leading the project and there's a few other researchers that are like in the kind of more like a b-roll style of footage there the film but they don't mention them by name they don't those people don't give like they don't have speaking parts or anything and then they don't talk about the use of the naval dolphins or anything like the whole thing yeah also show if you didn't yeah I didn't go dolphins we're good at finding the vaquita that's how they found the vaquita is in the first place it's not like they were just stumbling across them like they made it sound like in the film the dog located the animals it took a lot of training because there's there's talk that they did show bottlenose it always talked at the ball nose dolphin they're actually sometimes aggressive to harbor porpoise and what looks like harbor porpoise of Akita so they were worried about that that's but it's crazy means they brought these bottlenose down there just in Coronado like the journalist said it's amazing that this animals going extinct five hours drive from Los Angeles and they didn't talk about the land the land-based facility that was in San Felipe also mmm-hmm yeah there was a couple things left out of this story that I was like mm I wonder if the u.s. said please don't involve us in this if NOAA imps were like no no what's crazy is like I don't think any I wonder how I wanted to make a poll on my Instagram and see how many people have heard about the vaquita because like I know so many people have heard about southern resident killer whales right now yeah and there's what 73 left mm-hmm yeah but I bet nobody heard about the big there's literally people out there who love you know the certain residents who what's the vaquita like no so no like the vaquita definitely didn't get the attention from I would say the us that much no and I think it's probably true I mean even in Mexico I think if you went into the middle of mainland Mexico and said what's a vaquita they would been like what are you talking well as you seem to film yourself people in San Felipe is like they don't exactly know what it is they know what it is but they tell you it's yeah he's not real but I could I mean when you see one and you see like the markings around the on debris is funny - they look at you like this isn't real like this thing has eyeliner and lipstick this thing is not real and it lifts its head up funky to breathe yeah they're cool yeah try to go down there and just take a picture of one there's okay let's just say that some of the expeditions have literally been down there for a year and they will get one sighting yeah we're talking not like you know just researchers really shy animals and there's so few of them in such a big space that it's just like what are the odds of finding them and currently we're literally talking about a 100 like harbour porpoise make it we can literally probably count them on one hand so the the journalists made a good point in the or maybe it was the news anchor one of them made a good point towards the end that was like if we can't do this for the vaquita we're not gonna be able to do it for any other species you know like that's why there's so much even last-ditch effort to try and save them it's because if we it's like you start pulling on the thread when you lose the species and pretty soon the whole thing's gonna unravel if you can't save this one how are you gonna save the rest of them well you also said if you don't save the vaquita then the fishermen are gonna continue and the rest of the Sea of Cortez is doomed yeah because they're gonna they're gonna hit humpbacks the turtles all the fish you saw all the different fish that were in there all the sharks there was a baby hammerhead shark and some of that footage yeah yeah Shepard it's also an endangered species you know it's just he's right I mean if we can't do this how are we gonna do anything else I saw something on the side that resident killer whales so I forget who owns it but they must own the dam or something they were saying like extinct well I mean that I feel like that's the same thing if all the vaquita is go extinct then there's no motivation anymore to ban gill nets right like the vaquita were the poster child for the gill net ban nevermind all the other animals that died in them well you know okay so like the thing is is the killer whales are going extinct right this is a resident but their food is the reason why they're going extinct right so that means that food's gonna go extinct as well mm-hmm so that means no more salmon mm-hmm whatever means the same thing was a total opposite while very endangered - like you're not supposed to fish for them even hook in line you're not supposed to catch them at all I guess it's the wallet wallet Union bulletin have you heard of that I know where Walla Walla is but I don't they believe the dam should stay up and the workers and sandwich should go extinct Wow oh they said go give them a piece of your mind yikes that said yeah I'm guessing that that water if it feels their farms or something like that well yeah that's on the Snake River yeah yeah I don't know might be hydroelectric power - who knows but I think that if anything we need to learn more lessons from the vaquita even if it is too late and I think it's still worthwhile to teach people what they are because they are an important part of one of the most abundant ecosystems on earth I didn't realize like I need to see you a Cortez's crazy but I just think of it I thought of it it's like just another like Monterey but not a feeding ground but I guess it is kind of a feeding ground - that's the thing it's like feeding and breeding there mm-hmm it's like right in that middle ground huh yeah they think that they have resident blue whale and fin whale populations in the Sea of Cortez the ones that go to La Paz maybe I mean I'm not a pause go to Loretto Loretto that way up in there yeah yeah I think that's the ones that's too far they go pretty far up in there yeah they can spin sky no the fins can you can see blue whales in Loretto to it yeah Lori's not as far up as you guys think yeah yeah yeah but even gray whales they've been in fact during remember they're in the conference and they posted that gill net good actually mmm wrapped up but agree well like towards San Felipe we're like what like a good turn towards Fernanda who works over there yes you don't you like yeah yeah no but yeah the fender well thing that it does seem like certain areas have their fin well like I don't I hate using this word but yeah resident population a Southern California seems to have the same fin well let it show up over and over again at the 2015 marine mammal conference in San Francisco they actually had several talks about that that they think it is its own pop fin whales and blue whales in the Gulf of California yeah so what I was saying about the sea quartet sea Cortez is they have so many cool things they're like turtles those what you called rate that hobby leg of the race yeah which are in huge numbers and they breach out of the water and like they also have the other Ray there too Manta yeah that mana but there's no doubt like a spotted right there devil ray or something uh there's equal ratio race in the warmer water is they have a lot of cool stuff there that's all getting wrapped in those Nets mm-hmm I think even in watching that one of the things they caught in a net look leavin almost like a cow nose so I'm not sure if those make it up there but nowadays one thing that was cool was is that when they were pulling up the nest is that they were saving some what they were trying to save yeah but you saw like that ray they put better that like skate or whatever it was it had cuts all the fur that was the one yeah look how they were like lowering it in and then it slid out of it look like that yeah it looked like a cow nose but I'm just wondering if count it was even exist over there but yeah I remember that's the one I'm talking about yeah it's cute cute little guy that but apparently look like he was yeah I'm so I did have a question during the film which I think I leaned over and said to you I said it doesn't really look like they're taking data on what's in the Nets no I'm sure someone was probably just quickly jotting stuff down helps species in numbers because that could become quite compelling you eight hundred samples yeah you know that that could be pretty good for other species especially sharks yeah one big quality guy yeah I was big and they dumped that back out of eight hundred knots they got a thousand baby hammerhead yeah exactly I mean that could help you one get a sample of what's going on out there and to you sorry though the animals ages yeah yeah yeah and then also show like you know these are how many endangered species are getting caught in these nets not just not just so table and vaquita yeah so I hope they're taking the data that's all I can hopefully I'm sure someone is they're trying to hardest I mean it's not perfect but yeah you know what they didn't have footage of either and this had to have happened while they were filming because I think it was during CPR right before it there were three Vicki de in nets that were pulled up by sea Shepherd like right before operation CPR yeah yeah there's a few photos floating around of those that was hard yeah like they were about to go down and make this big effort and they found three dead ones and like in the span of like two weeks yeah the bycatch over there is just uh it's scary I think anyone who's deal nets are horrible we just stopped fishing with them we're really good at killing things they banned them in California yeah except for swordfish unless that actually went through I think that banned them in California period because there was like one exception for offshore drift gill no I'm short yeah I there was a mileage thing and that's you know the coastal ones are not allowed and that's one reason why I think some people think that the white sharks are seemed to be more so much more abundant now because those are gone that was actually hitting the white shark population pretty hard sure yeah yeah but I know for a while the offshore ones were still a problem I know I had their people watching the four bycatch and it was some bad bycatch I mean we're talking like sperm whales pilot whales ya know that they had the caveat that if there was one greased green sea turtle and any of those offshore swordfish nets the sword fishery would be shut down for the year like you catch one turtle you're closed yeah well wonder if I'm like offshore killer whales ever been in that source info I'm sure never no no no one's gonna say anything like they have like pilot whales and stuff I would think that they probably have caught him cut another whale before how do they know I could locate it I think it's so thin maybe it's not a film so it's just like it's fishing yeah we're not not enough for them to rely when they go and do it they freaked out yeah that's it like I said I said about that gray well it hit the lobster buoy and then it immediately like kicked his tail when it kicked it into the rope yeah wrap it came off right away but I've seen them react to that kind of thing yeah and they immediately you know wiggle and it couldn't they couldn't wiggle and twist in the wrong direction and wrap themselves up yeah especially because the line has such a strong like it doesn't break with a lot of it takes a lot of force to break it yes we're just gonna spread out yeah but also is just like a really strong material it needs like more than 80,000 pounds of force to break I feel like we have so much work to do to help the whales in the ocean yes and I mean in all and well so many animals have problems pretty much all animals do we gotta take better care of our earth I really do like that song we love you guys have I heard it yeah it's pretty good it has like a lot of views on YouTube yeah every like a big singer in it it's my little Dickie little Dickie yeah that's what we're listening to after we're done recording the music video No oh my god oh yeah we gotta watch it you know so I see well I think I watch ever heard of epic Rap Battles yeah the newest one is Jacques Cousteau and a Steve Irwin they have a rap battle all these people impersonate yeah yes yes yes yes I have heard of it yes well you know what Jacques Cousteau says about the Sea of Cortez it's the Aquarium of the world mm-hmm just saying there's a lot of cool fish there yeah man mm-hmm it's more like tropical than you think oh yeah like like but then it does get the cold waters well I was productive not Palau what's the place that's it's it's near it was near the pause my way it was a little further in hmm there's a really pretty place to dive there there's a lot of pretty places to dive near the paws but I forget the name about to look on the map was it some Islands or something Guadalupe Island is down there koala paisa it's up it's on a Pacific side that's where all the white sharks are yeah there's a lot of cool islands out there yeah Socorro Cedros also Kouros yes yeah for viajeros yeah that's good islands out there really neat places okay albatross and even if I'm wrong even though we're watching all that bad stuff happening in Mexico just watching the footage of them being in Mexico and we want to go back oh I know like dude when they show them like when from the bow angle of all those modularize jumping I was like dude yeah there were so many cool things I need to go film there that's why I wanted to this this company when summer comes up I want to go go swim with whale sharks let's go babe LA yeah over there see but they uh what's it called or you could give a pause in the winter you could do gray whales and la pause c-come in yeah that sounds muy divertido oceanic society if you're listening please take me back that was so cool I do want to go and see the other lagoons now that I've seen sound Ignacio I want to go to I promise you that where did I go Magdalena Bay was really good we had lots of whales I heard that it wasn't if I think it was really good because if they were saying they're opening up one even further south that one that maybe that one's doing better than people thought it was doing but it was interesting that it was good because the overall yeah yeah this was a poor gray well season yeah I mean I we went out of the whatever Harbert Bay like there's a bunch of little islands kind of in fire sandbar things you know mm-hmm but like there was like 30 whales right off the bat like just you can see them all surfing in the waves all down there and we didn't even go a mile like down the beach in there just all the way down so there's lots of great whales I mean we have lots of whales it's just like not a lot compared to how they say it normally is I can't wait to see what this new season has to offer yeah we'll see what happens on your trip off oh yeah do you guys want - is there any seats left yeah I think there's spaces laughs okay Erik's leading a gray whale trip yeah with my buddies yeah that'll be interesting you guys are curious just message us speaking of trips Slade you got all kinds of trips right now what are you doing we even talked about yet you just put them up today officially who heard it first folks it's like I don't plug it anywhere I plug it 3 episode the 25th you doing sunset Monterey oh yeah we have a sunset trip if you guys hear this now and you can be there by this weekend Sunday there's a sunset trip cool sick sunset and Slater got a cool new reservation system so he's like yeah yeah I have a sunset trip 25th I have San Juan Trippe that's two spots now left it's in September and then I have another all day all day in Monterey October yeah so I'll turn um no promises but I'll try and be on it all day trip in October you never go on any of them you're losers yeah I'm a big fan of scheduled to work I'm a big fan of slated more photography why you don't know if you could see us behind the scenes I'm the one that's helping with the execution yeah but you don't count so my friend me a giant come yeah thanks friends thanks guys we need to make a post or something because we need to post and do a lot of things yeah but now I guess dude I promise you guys he's promising on-air it's recorded I hope we got it I headed this out for those of you they're still following us and supporting us on patreon thank you appreciate it we have not been posting on there and we need to echo that too you did yes yeah good thank you Miss Martin - okay I'm the brains of the operation dang it so I'm excited to see how the rest of the fall goes we've got like weird things happening in the bay like south wind for four days straight I don't know what that's about in the middle of August but we'll see what happens oh you know what what random thing I want to bring up guys what I know we've had a lot of people actually our listeners who have actually kind of gotten their foot in the door because of us you know just because they listen to us there's an opening for interns which Cascadia so they're accepting applicants for fall summer and spring internships at Cascadia so if you guys don't know who cascade is yeah Cascadia is actually some of the more well-known and organized researcher of large whales out here along the west coast so humpbacks blue whale's tooth whales out in the Hawaiian Islands these guys are really big and john cowan Akitas as a probably I don't know I always considered the god of large whales a fangirl for a second yeah every time I see them yeah so look that up yeah message us if you need more details about that but I think Cascadia themselves actually posted something on face on their Facebook page about the openings is it in Washington or can they I don't know it's most likely based in Washington I don't know if they're doing the Hawaii people in Hawaii but I think I saved it you never know Slater you never know if they need someone to get some aerial stuff I saved it good matching of dolphins and whales as well as helping respond to strandings in Washington state policeman based out of our office in Olympia please share the flyer and check it out Cascadia research org slash about slash interns if you're interested in more information about the program internships are unpaid but office based positions in Olympia Washington housings not provided but you do photo ID data entry field data collection stranding response Beach surveys any cropsey's and pinnipeds and cetaceans and photo ID of baleen whales including humpback blue and gray off the west coast of the US there you go yeah so that sounds awesome everyone my photos f2 with Oh Dom seats so if you are a person looking to get your foot in the door this is a way to go and I know it's unpaid but trust me Katelyn will tell you you know that's the way it goes in this field you gotta really want it guys a lot of us have been volunteers at zoos and aquariums or other you know well or while watching companies together our foot through the door yeah for sure and Cascadia is a really high highly reputable organized and then if there's anyone to do an unpaid intern she I'd want to do it right now yeah so the Hawaii thing I don't know if it's based in Hawaii but they have their own projects page for that and their own separate application so you need to send a resume in Hawaii because we know people that work there yeah I just don't know if the ID work is like you have to be in Hawaii to do it or if you just do it at the Washington office and then talk to the Hawaii people but it says if you want to do the u.s. west coast you're talking to Kirsten Flynn and then it's a separate person for the piers tan ship she's cool yeah you need two letters of recommendation a letter of interest and a CV resume cover letter and two references your head the well nerds well nerds sent me yeah put us in his ear how'd you hear about us so yeah so that's an opportunity out there for those of you that are looking for something yeah I was gonna call you guys about that they are today saying it was a good to be a good thing to bring up for all our our younger folks trying to get their foot in the door thank you for remembering yeah yeah mm-hmm yeah it's you guys always tell me about those happy messages again about people actually yes it makes our day when people say that we inspired them all right guys well friends about 35 floor all the spoilers for sea of shadows the end actually is pretty crazy you're like you realize how serious of a matter it really is yeah yeah we're not gonna talk about that's why I was like oh we'll save a few spoil I know I was about to bring it up I was like wait we just ruined most of them bring it tissue or to at issue yeah and be ready to walk out pissed off like I did yeah it's automated to say yeah yeah it's a little bit of anger a little bit like oh crap this is real let's save the whales yeah it's not just you learned that it's just not just the conservation yeah it's more than that all right thank you guys have a good day bye everyone

-

hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of the whale owners podcast episode number 35 and I'm here with Eric and Caitlin hey everyone hello and we are three weeks behind and it's work a lot yeah it's been so busy all whale stuff luckily it just shows you how amazing this Monterey Bay area can be for us working here than three people's schedules is kind of tricky twelve hour days - yeah that's cave we saw lots of cool whale stuffs in the last three weeks exactly a lot of neat stuff has been happening out here and some well news has popped up yeah talk about first sightings let's talk about sightings I think we've all have had some pretty good sightings the last few days go go first you go Caitlin me go go for it um okay so I'm trying to think when the last time we recorded did we see that great well that great killer whale calf since I know okay so we had an unusual group of killer whales around which I was just talking to Eric about on our way here I think it's this potentially the CA 55s have a calf that's very light-colored gray kind of like that one in the Pacific Northwest and it still has fetal fold so it's really young and it's been seen three times in the last few weeks and the last two sightings it was also with the to 16 so Jagan's group and but I don't think it's one of Jagex family members because this afternoon it was not there has it run three times they're more than three times already yeah the 16th of August and then Wednesday and then you guys saw it this morning the 16th of August mm-hmm the first time I saw Wednesday yeah okay yeah oh wow okay yeah so that's been pretty interesting to see humpbacks have been around numbers have kind of fluctuated a lot and there's been some blue whales really really really really far offshore except today we saw one charging up the coast cuz killer whales scared the out of it very much sorry and Rizzo's and Whitesides have been around a lot yeah like uh nothing like too crazy just like around yeah just good numbers of animals and a good variety it was that blue really that close to the killer whales this afternoon I don't know how close it was but all of a sudden we were catching up to the siding and we saw this huge splash and I was like yes they're hunting something and then we look at the other boat that's what the killer whales was like okay they're nowhere near the splash so what just happened and then all of a sudden this blue whale was charging up past us and I was like oh okay yeah it was going like oh well over ten knots it was pretty wild so I was pretty cool and then lots of molas as per usual lots of sea nettles near the harbor which is so fun for your sea strainers on the boat yeah that's kind of it for me yeah not much different from me too just the sheer number of humpbacks out there good variety of dolphin and then obviously today the orcas siding with that little great calf that is not the one that Slater saw a month ago or so it's actually a different one when people saw that right away they're thinking oh we getting visitors from the north thing in it but they compared for those right away it turns out it's a different little gray individual does it have rake marks on it mm-hmm no it doesn't look like it pretty clean but it's a it's younger than the one that you saw so it's kind of crazy you know right away people compared for those going oh wow it's a different one huge eye patch - yeah huge eye patch and I'm trying to think what else has been out there that's oh yeah I forgot about Casper yeah Casper's been seen about twice just this week in fact I've been out twice this week and I also still never seen that dang dolphin been here the whole time that that dolphins been sighted I've lived here yeah I've never seen it yeah if you guys don't know about Casper I think all three of us have posted photos of him he's a cute little albino riza that's been showing up here last few seasons growing up - every time we'd see it gets bigger and bigger and still pure white lousy you know Rizzo's not like that white but look literally like white white it's pretty amazing yeah you just have more yellow on it to it so that's actually Slayer it still has like some diatoms on it yeah when you get a good sharp photo like my lenses poopoo but like well the lens like yours you'll see it yeah still a lot of diatoms on it well sounds like it's been good out there with Kate oh it's awesome we had lunch feeding humpbacks sweet well we didn't have a sunset I think I had my first sunset on Friday that I've had all season yeah so we went out there and we kind of came all the way over don't we left was I wanted blue ocean so we left out of Moss Landing and we came we can't we went all the way over to like Marina and then we had just a couple humpbacks and then we pushed a little further towards Monterey and then ran into a big group of like five or six humpbacks that started feeding and you guys I'm doing everything right he got lunging reaching yeah so it was awesome oh my god three or four breaches a lot like lunch feeding every like two minutes so it was pretty good your trips always end up really good Kate coming ships always it good and you got another one coming up right no no no no not for well in at two months out to the next month yeah 11:30 yeah and then yep I'm leaving I'm leaving in two weeks to San Juan Island I know guys we're all traveling here but luckily we'll yeah we'll have so much to talk about we're all going to whale areas which is great do you have any seats on your San Juan strip Rico sold out we sold out nice that's gonna be awesome happy some of the pictures from up there some people we know are up there look that big right now nearly everyone's up there I talked to Taylor like two days ago on the phone he said they have 60 transients and residue oh man that's gonna be awesome all right so someone sent us a quiz on Instagram I'm scared you know I think it has to do with the Pacific Northwest oh okay see how we do it's her name is Brooke so Brooke sent us this Thank You Brooke and let's see so which one of these killer whale populations are endangered a northern residents be transient or bigs orcas see southern residents or D boom go ahead and lock it in lock it in please you're wrong what just kidding Wow I'll close this it even gives you a little fact there are approximately 73 Wow yeah Wow this from CBO it's from Canada yeah that's cool oh really cool let's read this actually they're approximately 73 southern resident killer whales left they are also the population living almost year-round near major urban centers here's why there's an international fight to save them that's a it's a hot link okay yeah whoa up there they're listed as threatened so hey that's pretty cool maybe we'll put this link somewhere yeah that'd be cool the pod beam what does or kindness or Kyle of this one we talked about this one but this is funder what does or kindness or cthe a scientific word for killer whales mean a or kindness equals realms of the dead Orca equals shape of a barrel this is kind of hard to say huh hey or how about God of offshore relatives under the water feared one assassin whale murder whale or blubber chopper I don't know because I would save anything realms of the Dead in shape but or like yeah it's underwater it's the first one I don't think it's the third one you know it's the first like death from below or like it's something relative it's the first one actually cuz Orca does translate to some languages as a barrel or a big jar oh wow let's he verax right and various european languages the animals have similar names associated with the death and killing in fact all of these words in the quiz translations of some languages see ya say all of those together kind of yeah exactly yeah you're right yeah parts of them are used in better languages and stuff yeah Saxon well murder well yeah yeah yeah see look at or kindness means the kingdom of the Dead belonging to Orcus the Roman god of the underworld that's the kind of exactly huh sweet cuz isn't it in Spanish isn't that like a it's like a Sat the word assassins in it isn't it I'm not sure you would know mote you hablo mucho Espanola no all right third question I think there's only ten orcas use sound to hunt food navigate find mates or all of the above all of the above mm-hmm really don't be checking them out first they're sizing them up like let me see what you got going on there orcas rely on echolocation for all the above reasons chips need to stay back how many meters away from killer whales in the Salish Sea it depends on what it is though because I think it's different between private and well this is the Canadian I thought it was 400 is 404 but it's like 200 if you're a whale watch boat and you have like a certificate at sea 400 locked in at 400 right good job later so 400 times with 3 yeah was a mile away a mouse 5 200 okay we're being dramatic it's still 5 that's like four football fields away what is a kilometre a thousand meters which would be three thousand feet like a third what two-thirds of a mile yeah you're gonna tell me say you can't see them don't ask me to do math scientists have declared that the greatest threat to j-pod is lack of chinook salmon a lack of chinook salmon be early pregnancy failure see loss of matriarch j17 for noise pollution I think it's like I should make Sam yeah but all those all those have been brought up but yeah it's a I think for this time lack of salmon salmon chamois right 98 percent of the southern residents summer diet is salmon yes what's their winter day it's always salmon they for salmon yeah yeah different types of salmon what are the biggest challenges facing chinook salmon the favorite food source of the southern resident killer whales oh it's all of these ice our warming oceans habitat degradation harvesting and all of the above oh right fisheries and oceans sea warming oceans habitat destruction on harvesting as factors in salmon decline yeah it's like the fish farms is two dams it's yeah warming ocean you know changing commercial fishing which of the following is the most true for Orca pregnancies 14 to 16 years old before they reach reproductive maturity oh that was a B every four or five years providing adequate food and no chemicals sea births only four or five calves over a lifetime one or two might survive well they say the first because they say that the first calf usually doesn't make it because releasing all their chemicals right yeah through the milk work a female yeah right Orca females have a life cycle remarkably similar dang we should go on like a what's that Orca job how to be a millionaire who was he a millionaire yeah well question probably should be father actually technically your questions invalid oh my god you guys I watched a video the other day and it was like talking about it was it was debating the fact that Moby Dick ate someone and then spit him out or something or they know they cut it open and there and that he was inside forget the name we can watch that video it shows a picture of a humpback right and they put teeth oh yeah they were talking about how the teeth of kill oh my god it was such a bad like animated video but the facts were true yeah they will swallow anything raishin was bad yeah it always happens yeah they like you it's like they use wrong whales yeah it's like I feel like they always used to blue Oh for like a humpback or something yeah yeah very true question number eight how have pollutants affected the southern resident pollutants is a hard word to say oh not yeah pollutants affected the southern resident orcas pollutants are concentrated in mother's milk and passed to the calf PCB contamination affects that what species what is that there are chemicals in plastic okay so PCT PCB contamination affects the immune system reproductive health and brain development thank you plankton can potentially a mistake microplastics as food source all of the above all of the above - when it comes a wildlife is just like and it's negative it's all yeah it's a polychlorinated biphenyl which is in main chemicals guys all the statements are correct and episode 4 of The Killers podcast some Canadians have a killer podcast we got to check it out now I'm definitely gonna look at it that's pretty cool Mobe Dahl was a member of which family we just read about this later I know okay a transient B southern residents C northern residents for Offshore's oh I don't remember what he was I think it's a I thought I forget when I hated transient but then I was in Colby's book I think it's at Randy I think it's a transient oh wait but then it not eat food I don't know they hurt poo in the poor thing yeah at the back but we just failed wait wait do not get to go pass all the other questions but are we gonna go again we just held it was literally in that book we did what was it called a cult yeah how we came to know that don't ask us for the Cliff Notes version the book anymore well guess what I'm reading on the way to Norway are you mad yes I can I already finished I should read it again yeah it was southern resident and I remember them saying that the pod was like nearby like and another like passageway like and they they were vocalizing through the net what it was held in okay number 10 approximately how many orcas were caught in Washington state british columbia waters and sold two aquariums before the practice was banned ooh I want to say 76 the options are for 76 50 or 17 it's either 50 or 76 I want to say 76 but 76 was that were actually sold or 76 was the year that they actually stuck so 1972 washingto was a rejection Act but they didn't stop doing it because he world had permits or whatever it was and then I think I had to have taken like 70 for sure what do you guys think Sam British Columbia I think yeah but they're on the border they said that they actually I think they stopped it in Canada first yeah and then they were just waiting for the border I think they didn't want Americans catching them in Canada was the drama really I don't know I feel like it's 50 I don't know no okay so let's go you guys wanna go through yeah let's go 50 I'm saying 76 okay I'm switching that last second Oh see they threw 76 in there because it was a year they stopped they tried to throw I say Columbia during the 1960s and 1970s there was a gold rush on Orcas that were captured for sale cuz I worry that they took it to Iceland yeah yep they did all right let's do our results we got one wrong they said you guys don't like whales stories high price for a stellar performance Sharon oh speaking of Stellar's we've been seeing stellar sea lions too yeah that's pretty neat they've learned it's the same couple of ones it actually has been cuz Pete took one that was in front of off of point peanuts on the buoy and I took a picture of another one off of the mile marker in front of Moss Landing it was the same one that had the same pink lower jaw a little dot on its lower jaw so yeah I've been seeing the one with the big scar on its back the shark bites is something I still do yeah oh no what yeah there's a big and then we think it's a female no haven't yeah it rolled over and it looked like it was a female and she has some shark bites on her back like by her shoulders oh we also had some friends that went on a pelagic birding trip in Half Moon Bay and I guess said they said there's a lot of Stellar's just slightly north of us pretty interesting yeah I've ever even been to Half Moon Bay dude let's go be fun to go there for what they did a birdie whales and stuff out there yeah I don't even wear watch anymore yeah you do all verreaux's bird trips have been having good luck ouch I was like every time they went out there yeah and lots of whales and then killer whales one of the days also that literally whales around let her back also they had the and the the killer well they had was actually a transient more common up north yeah do you know as I've been seeing whales and I feel bad as a Newport Beach you know well did you see the funny man photo that looks like a ship strike person but right here I'm looking for it on her page she didn't post it here he goes I saw it on Facebook oh yeah she sent them to me personally I saw Don Cheadle fauna but it looks like it got hit on the right side by a ship and like because I posted something I just figured well and she's like look at this we broken dude no it's good a glass case oh it's a highlighted pink yeah another thing is she said that one of the PEC fin wasn't worthy because I guess sperm whales yeah yeah if you didn't see the dorsal you would think that that gets burnt well she posted that video something weird in Seattle fauna on the Facebook group and when it swims you can totally see that like it must have got hit on the left and then the damage as it tried to read you know continue growing it was like all like the right PEC fin doesn't work because the spines all out of place and stuff let me see if I can find the video it's gnarly I was like oh that poor whale that's that's not good let's see here there's so many things in this group all the time which is like a good thing but then it's hard to hear think of the videos later yeah I thought unearthing yeah down one oh no I think just from the side like this we're like the yeah it like kind of rolls to the right side when it comes up and the right PEC doesn't work hmm poor thing yeah well it's obviously doing fine and a scar on the left side of its head yeah that's not the only whale we've seen out there over the years all of us have seen that kind of Wales with disfigurements crooked backs and stuff like that yeah gray whales humpback whales see and some of them obviously are doing pretty well because we keep on seeing some of them yeah that's true yeah Eric has a sad ship strike story oh yeah just get it all the way yeah so obviously a lot of us here know that ship strike is you know something that our whales have to worry about on our part specific editor then someone with a harpoon anymore but just the the other day our buddies up in San Francisco from a San Francisco whale tours we're out whale watching you know I think they said close to Alcatraz and the dad humpback whale and we're able to actually warn a cargo ship to hey you know this humpback well in front yeah move out of the way and the cargo ship actually responded and moved so they were out there still watching whales an hour later unfortunately one cargo ship actually did unfortunately strike an animal and they reported that there was a large pool of blood the size of a football field and then see the whale again so that is unfortunately what our whales have to deal with they decide to head towards the San Francisco Bay Area yeah probably float they do think in there they're already going really slow right inside the bay and so yeah I think they have to go pretty slow yeah and those pilots are usually pretty aware of what's going on I didn't know but they have different pilots like one for the offshore area I guess the pilot jumps on about fourteen or sixty miles out Oh dead more towards like that area between Golden Gate Bridge and then it gets further in there's another pilot so they all specialize in the certain area oh wow yeah yeah it's really sad I'm you know obviously it's something that these guys don't do on purpose but you know it's one of the things or else have to deal with and we got busy ports just go bad and Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach so it's tough for him out here along the California coast so one of our listeners Schnauzer on instagram message s it looks like there's a few to let she's into a couple things and but the last one she sent she was here last November right I could read over shoulder so I shouldn't guess it's something we saw this week well you saw this week Caspar yeah yeah how could one of our listeners have seen it and I haven't you know that's probably the same listener saw the letter back to stop oh that actually happened not possible it's October kids they Bennett he saw a leatherback while he was here and he like met me on the boat and he's one he's one of our listeners and I was like what the heck funny kid got to see the turtle and I didn't I mean good for you Bennett but I'm still salty I'm flying out in October hopefully spend two days on the water and really wondering your thoughts on the Farallon Islands ship or should I instead go to Moss Landing slash Monterey also any Monterey do mall less you want to see unless you can afford to do them on you want to see white sharks at the farallon's yeah fair lines during the fall is the best time to see white sharks what the weather could be true going to the Farallon school oh yeah yeah I don't you're less likely to get canceled here in October you know it's probably good weather there too if it is here I would do both of you could yeah you can do them all and you're willing to be flexible just seeing the farallon's is is neat yeah it's amazing set of islands especially that Devils teeth area I mean if you're here in October and it's on the 11th is very true there's a 19 spots left all right October 11 Friday you work Fridays Eric yeah I'll probably be cleaning the boat for you hmm I'll get it ready for you two things add one thing for sure so this beak twill thing I have a little bit of a correction on if I've talked about this before did you pan one right yes because I thought the arnux beaked whale was the new identified species off Japan but that's the one in the southern hemisphere in the Pacific okay that looks like a bird speak 12 okay so off Japan they've officially given a scientific name to what the common name is the black bear to speak to oil oh how creative let me find the scientific name they've been calling them Karasu is like kind of the common term for them when they see them they see the amount of hokkaido in japan so yeah we got to go sure otoko let's go in the the word means crow in japanese why can I not find the scientific name the BER are Deus minimus hmm now is this the one they found in the fishing net and the fisherman was quick enough to take a picture but then he dumped it overboard or is this the one that beat they've had a couple strandings over the years okay um and then they had some live sightings at sea mm-hmm they've had six stranded beaked whales on the north coast of Japan off the oxy of a cost or yeah a cost that borders with Russia and then they've been able to do some DNA testing based on those strandings but then they have been seeing them alive as well in the DNA test it was 100% 100% they were artists minimus funny joke about something yes just by looking at them we could tell that they're remarkably smaller and body size have more of a spindle shaped body a shorter beak and a darker color compared to other known Berardi of species so that's pretty cool now their new species of beaked whale that is cool I saw a thing on Facebook mm-hm and they're saying that there's gonna be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050 yes and people have been working on like ways obviously we're like it's gonna be next to impossible to get rid of plastic out of like because it's just you know it's on everything yes yeah it's like a chip bag it's plastic you know I mean so everything's plastic yeah yeah and so they've developed a technology and there's a lot of science words here so I'm just gonna just read it we're gonna make it sound simple basically it dissolves the plastic and it does there's like two stages and when it dissolves the plastic into like some sort of zaimes words crazy words thanks no cattle enzymes and then catalyst catalyzed yeah anyways and then after that it turns it to water hmm and it's biodegradable okay I'm not crazy I mean what are you gonna do it you're gonna have a big been assigned drop your chip back in it and just dissolves it yeah they have like um bugs that eat plastic and turn it into something that's more like closer to a biodegradable substance yeah we're gonna have to do something dude cuz like this is gonna be laid down the ocean is not like we got to stop before a kid's ocean I think sad news yeah I agree because like we're not getting it out I mean we can get I'm not saying we're not gonna but we're not gonna get all of it we got to turn the faucet off before we can clean up the rest yeah you know I'm saying what you don't like right algae it's but here's another like trippy thing about like plastic is gonna be laid down in this like geologic record right when you take a core sample of the earth yeah yeah it's gonna be in the geologic record so seawater travels really slow in the deep sea like the water that gets welled up in Monterey Bay during upwelling about a thousand years old so we're still gonna have this microplastic problem for thousands of years no matter when we stop like it's just mind-boggling yeah it's scary well to me it's the plastics gonna get smaller and smaller over the years though right yeah like that Marine snow that's already on the bottom that's coming back up in a thousand years nice I'm depressed now sorry well at least this lady is out here she saw some problems I'll be okay with water I'm hoping it fresh waters good where's our drinking plastics like someone's defect you don't use that plastic water oh I'm just gonna drink the water water laughter I'm gonna drink it I am proud to say that at Discovery we're down to our last plastic bottled beverage in the fridge when that orange juice bottle goes nothing no glass drinking or getting recycled tomorrow not a single thing yeah I love our our the cans of water that's neat yeah I'm just afraid of drinking in the wheelhouse cuz it looks like I'm drinking a blue moon oh stop it's watered it looks like a Coors Light - I don't know I don't know when I'll take it I just watched drinks on TV good all right I don't gonna get white claws yes there was a shortage I'm not kidding that's why I tried to FaceTime you earlier I was like there's a shortage you can't buy you can't oh my god that's so fun right guys welcome to the alcohol awesome Labor Day I'm sure just probably got what I got you know like for like a month now what is a white car it's just a seltzer water yeah even one go I'll start drinking and we'll try one hopefully they're still there when I get there there's got a pill you can take I don't think it's a pill I didn't I'm straight-out allergic to alcohol but is it all alcohol cuz maybe you can drink like sake like rice up I tried sake - and that made me feel funny I tried talking well yeah it's supposed to make you feel funny and Katelyn and amber saw me drink yeah no but I've had wine and tequila and on Stephanie on it tequila makes riding okay yeah oh there's a story actually yeah there's a few whale watchers out there who know about me and Baja and yeah riding the whale no luckily a drink tequila wasn't the accident I was in chemo going no I was handed margaritas and at least they gave me that chocolate wine she got from like uh uh Trader Joe's and I was like the palapa always like tilted and I asked everyone is this room dude they're like no you're drunk I don't like like if I was like on like not working or something you know now I was on the boat I don't really like to drink and shoot photos remember don't don't drink and shoot well dude it just brought to you by Slater more photography you're more likely to hold your camera not aimed at the whale okay whenever you have one of your photo clinics against later you gotta bring this up guys try not to drink and shoot why are your friend this blurry single photo start from today dang it so I have some up are you ready for more depressing news since we're talking about you know alright let me keep my sharp objects away from me yes okay so um looks like the blob might be back is that with all this orange yellow or this water is people having red tide so this is put out by NOAA a couple days ago new marine heat wave emerges off the west coast resembles the blob so if you don't remember what that was five years ago we had a really weird warm water event where just this big patch of warm water sat off the west coast and really messed things up with massive sea lion deaths we had bad salmon socks is that why there was that corinth of the day that's dying do you see that yeah so then things like sued Anita the red tide plankton which produces demonic acid does better in warm water so then you have that issue on top of the stress on the food system so NOAA Fisheries is focusing additional monitoring on the new heat wave across the Northeast Pacific for any listeners out in Hawaii I know they're getting ready for a big curl read bleach a bit a coral reef bleach event because it's been so warm for so many weeks already that they're worried all the corals are gonna start dying and it's it's anticipated that it's gonna have some effects on fish stocks mm-hmm which then could echo across the other parts of the food web the blob could potentially dissipate quickly a ridge of high pressure dampen the winds lately but it looks like you know current forecasts show that it could mop it could moderate in the next few months so we'll see what happens hmm well the last time there were warm water blob what didn't do we have like hundreds of fin whales here or something or nothing in the middle loads of humpbacks near shore that's when that whole sea lion humpback thing started and lots of whales pushed in late in the year like the first year in 2013 was when they were all here through December in lunge feeding and stuff inside the bay and like would you guys say crazy there was not as many humpbacks this year as last summer or you guys have been having like the trip of your life out there and I don't know about it oh actually I think a little bit less things that show up later for sure but I'm sure that vibe yeah it's a little bit less less definitely less than 2016 but we're so spoiled here are less is still freaking spectacular spreading out yeah I think that is also true I'm curious to hear how those offshore bird trips went today there was two 12-hour trips that went out from Monterey they're not going to be back for another 30 minutes from now or tomorrow I'm just guessing but because it was so calm today compared to what the forecast said I know some of them were like over 20 miles off shore they're trying to go to the like tuna ground area Oh so I'd be curious to hear what's going on out there yeah blue whale party out there guaranteed where's Chris when you need him huh for an all-day trip yeah we made a run drive like 27 miles for no reason oh we got shows later than we we made a huge run to like 48 and 12 or so you're fin weld a dude but no wait a blue whale last week and I was like why are we this far from Monterey are we having lunch in Santa Cruz Harbor cuz that would be close early it was crazy it is crazy but in the long run warm water is not good for no food so no so we'll see what happens I'm wondering if we're gonna have a nice late fall like short term gains for long term losses one thing I noticed our sea surface temp warmer compared to last year more consistently we it's been 66 consistently haven't been out two weeks is the water green nope it was blue outside outside yeah and then it was Green inside the point and then it Radel kind of red by the harbor it was so red like rusty red until like today yeah yeah you did I haven't gone out since September since I haven't gone out in September because I was gone for like thirty first to the third oh yeah yeah you were on yeah yeah yeah I was like it's crazy like you go through patches of that red tide and it's like so thick taking a video on my way in it like was not yelling on the phone yeah it was not photos really well it's really weird you're like this that some type of mmm my lens dirty and you look back like woah yeah Margo and I went and walked the lovers point or like just passed there in between there and Asilomar mm-hm and we were looking down and it was like brown water on like just all sorts of yeah it's been pushing into the shore the harbor was so gross until like this morning oh yeah Barbara was bad one of the deckhands on a fishing boat said there was some bioluminescence in the harbor this morning - OH someone messaged me about that they're like can you see by is it that bioluminescence kind yeah uh it could be this time of year is when it most frequently shows up yeah the Monterey Bay area late summer is that done we know at the end of the month and they have a tour I think on September 26 so we could go well you be back no no you guys go are you gonna be back I leave the 19th yeah yeah I take him kayak okay let's play I love it okay cool no listen talk ear talked about Norway so we're gonna have to bioluminescence well the only thing is is it something we have funny of eric is appalling it was really funny when Eric fellas last and then I just like push the character the dog in his swam back the guide was like whoa you're glowing on your back oh my god that I'd be so scared I'm not afraid of sharks at sea otters wasn't that year is the year before that that's yeah chase you're chased my dad your dad yeah they're not oh wait they are cute but they're not they're terrified yeah actually got on the back of Tim Taylor's car jumped in the back yeah right got to pause up there and I got a brief guide yeah the rush over he's only good my dad was just like just say your prayers bye yes they go for the right parts they probably tell you they're that mean just like go for your face yeah when I first moved here there was a news report that a lady disturbed one on the beach and she got mauled in a clawed her face did her boat get too close to oh never mind I think it was on the beach I don't know for sure I just remember hearing it and I was like I'm scared now yeah so when you're watching the whales with the red tide mm-hmm I've noticed that if you don't pooping disturb me yeah they were welling it up like it might not look red at the surface but after they've been feeding especially as sea lions all the sudden it's red where they've been that's how it is on the drone every time they they can't get leave the red plume yeah but that's evidence of the whale pump so I've been like nerding out about that so like when the whales are moving up and down in the water column they're mixing the water right and that's a perfect visual of how it works because they change the color of the water tell them to stop doing it makes the water okay you think they care no I don't think they care at all thousands of jellies I don't think they care at all how do they get to a Y and then come then go back to this green not here but like when they go to Alaska they go yeah there they go and they see all this beautiful blue water why even come back what if it's not beautiful to them what if they're like oh this means it's hot but they're so hungry they're like I just got to go up there new you what about like you go to Arizona and you're like wow look at this clear blue sky and it's hot AF here and then you go back to the Pacific Northwest and you're like oh this is so nothing that ever like oh like they sweat or what what would you will sweat ah I got you guys hmm they can't sweat underwater why not no human sweat under water yeah but once you get out of the water you start sweating I think they have lighter waves of thermal regular I think they push blood movement to their skin in that little corpus cavernosa Mexico yeah in their mouth yeah but to come on were they gonna do open their mouths over there yes they did video they just open Oh underwater you mean yeah okay yeah that's cool it's kind of like a dog when it lays down and starting panting do you think they just let water in their mouths yeah yeah that'd be cool to just watch out humpback just keep doing that everyone fast remember that little mystery gel between the lower mandibles they think that actually says the flow of water probably coming into their mouth so it helps some lunch feed and maybe even thermal regulate yeah wait what book do they talk about that end in Nick patents spying on Lou oh did you finish that book have Ian start you just read me I don't let you know something Eric is revising for the audible so I'm never gonna get a book in know he's gonna read them read them he's gonna read them but you could he's gonna read whale books on vacation yeah you know what guys if someone wants to babysit the Shaq yeah you'll see on all the books sitting there so it is a sharp podcasters oh no not the listeners so happy creepy you know can you come watch my place watching all week actually cool yeah you're just oh [Music] no I just like you know it's not like pictures of me just like all kinds of nerdy like also well well whale things dude buy one of those condos up at Pajaro dunes that has a mandible over the door I have legal I have legal whale bones Roe there's got to be legal well but yeah because they're fossilized and I got them from private property what do I know someone has to get some legal literally got them and like the 50s that have washed up on the beach Oh didn't even say it yeah I saw this picture Slater Shelby's like um that's a sperm whale job yeah but he's got like they gotta be like in real the chain of custody then you can have it those are old yeah yeah okay what if we were like what if it got down there trying to see you and you're like let's take you to the science and then they like like this is like got to carbon dated yeah but that legal place in case you listeners are wondering about getting legal well fossilized whale bones there's a location it's famous amongst paleontologists it's called shark shark tooth hill in Bakersfield you can actually go to the plane this yeah that's the fun part you actually have these trips yeah they got they got trips a few times a year that they had let you on this private property you can collect what you want something yeah some things they won't let you keep because sometimes you find stuff that's so awesome it's like actually valuable to science but ancient dolphin skulls of the fire I came across whole whales will like a whole whale skeleton that they actually support like this protectant over because some people have ranches there the cows will trample it and it's called shark tooth hell because you get ancient mako shark teeth are like everywhere you don't even usually it's a cooler time of the year it's it's usually led by a Wayne Avista Museum and Bakersfield but it's sold out we're never going to go and I'm just gonna get really sad it does it is pretty popular and it is like it's actually it's for real paleontologists it's like almost no fun because they're everywhere and I mean I yeah I found let it let her back ancient like old leatherback sea turtles scoot spot grab it or not that one no that one what if I find a freaking PEC fin they'll probably keep chunks of it it all depends on that the person part of it yeah no there's some tree I'm gonna get me a paint brush that's what we actually use the paint brushes there to kind of customize I'll show you guys the pictures later yeah it's that's really fun and the twisters want to do it yeah it's flick ever as well yeah shark-tooth Hill in Bakersfield led by the unless you know someone who owns property over there but yeah it's usually you had to go through that museum Buena Vista Wade oh yeah Bakersfield Alaska oh it's Bakersfield this is right next to the Kenai Peninsula possibly there Alaska has amazing Falls fine I'll go to Alaska darn dude I bet they got whale bones there I'm sure they found my mammoth tusks and all kinds of crazy now if I find that do I get to keep it a mammoth tusk yeah whoa so everything a marine mammal everything here guys and down is all from shark-tooth Hill so Mason yeah it's all my stuff there's a letter back turtle scoots yeah oh speaking of marine mammals that are like a little bit out there Eric and I went to the ACS talked and learned about Oh polar bears bears yeah hey do you guys bring a like water with you yeah it's really hot over there so no no not to drink like how do you get that out you just got a chisel it out it sold out yeah you brought that home with you yeah well the chisels in the back of my Jeep right now dude what will you be getting fossils right now whoa do you do that a fossil there ye yes that's a dinosaur footprint um next to yeah in case you guys know eric is also a dinosaur paleo nerd if you depe sowed one two three and four ostrich footprints those are in Colorado these are yeah it's Colorado this yeah Wow that's how I got stopped at the airport because I got an imprint of that and they thought it was plastic explosives so I got stopped at the airport late swap tested my dinosaur footprint like when I brought to you by not the actual footprint but it improve it a cast of it and think about it was a plastic explosive so they swapped it the guys like oh it's one of these and he was like oh cool I mean they told me I'm like what's the weirdest dinosaur thing he came through here he's like well this is Colorado so the biggest thing I've had it was a four foot long had reformed Hadra Hadrosaurus femur dinosaur favor yeah bro yeah those are whale ribs and mandibles and stuff yeah oh God so yeah like Slater's freaking out guys over these pictures yeah so check it out everyone Bakersfield yeah whoa look at nautilus shell is that even an ammonite it's yeah there's empty yeah oh it's later some of those are actually close to home some of those are from Silverado Canyon back in Orange County yeah I thought it was you know that was funny is seeing like seashells at the river and at the Colorado River like way up yeah well like in the Grand Canyon I mean I guess it runs down to the ocean but and this to us well nerves is probably the most fascinating it's actually a whale tooth right here I don't know but yeah look at that no no could be a sperm whale so speaking of scientific discoveries Eric huh didn't you want to talk about mullet Ekta oh yeah I'm all attacked uh so yeah I think I talked about this a few episodes of well back because I'm big fish nerd man I'm ever kind of nerd well cuz we talked about the one that washed up in Santa Barbara yeah so that one there's a molar that washed up in Santa Barbara a few months ago called mullet Ekta at first they thought that that species only existed down towards the southern hemisphere but obviously not since it washed up in Santa Barbara and over the last few days divers out here you know learning the news realized that there's more type of you know more than just mola mola out there that there's mola techba a new species here in Monterey and it's spotted live and divers have actually got underwater footage of it and the difference between them and mola mola is so slight from a well watching boat you know we usually won't be able to tell you the difference but if people were to put the animal side by side you could probably see a difference in the body shape like I've probably seen one yeah and there's other little features in the body that you really have to hit one yeah oh God oh yeah you guys a mola mola on my all my son's head trip and you guys already know that she's been dodging mola mola less yeah we're literally like oh my God look how big this mole is oh so we're looking at No so we're looking at one like two hundred yards off the right no and then there was one coming right at them in the balance he turned admit we missed it but where I looked at the captain I looked down and then I looked at the captain I was like did you even see that yeah no it was like that was as big as a car hood has been happening I'll see ya - were both big took us out yeah yeah that would have broke the propeller so which ones have all detective Samoa tech does the common name is hoodwink er wait is it darker no it's lighter isn't it varies so here's the thing so there's mola mola mola mola Tector there is mola Ram Zi but they think mola Ram Zi another one called mola alexandrina I see I think are actually the same animal so they've been having this debate since 2017 there's also a different genus there's also different genus - so yeah we got like sharp tail it's like we got slender which I've been lucky enough to see I was like I never thought I'd see that in my lifetime so the mullet ekta has smaller awesome what is it called ossicles yeah you got a look on the monterey bay aquarium put out a really good white patches in the basket yeah sort of tail is and then they have like more of a keel on their head and their back I wish there's a way we can just pump out a bunch of links so where people can look it up themselves but Monterey Bay Aquarium oh they said how the tumbler was gone but I guess Monterey Bay Aquarium has a tumblr and they put a really good chart showing the difference that's the difference but showing what the mola Tector has I think what a longer and more oblong body - yeah so if you guys want to be a super nerd when you're on the boat yeah my photos look at all my whole the pictures cuz I'm sure I'm Sophie with one for ya look at that one I can't you start doing that but most of the time I think most likely it's gonna be mala and now you might get some touch-up to make it a mola mola instead of them oh no I think that you know what the obstacles are pretty big in the back I think is a mullet that might be actually a welcome although it's a baby more remember we saw in the harbor mm-hmm there's one we were walking around following around along the dock yeah that's the young ones that I was like oh it's just a young mola mola but it could have been something else but you know the moles are so fascinating especially this year with so many big ones in the area it's like we need to talk to a mullet ish enormo ologist oh you know we're starting to come in I saw a lot yeah they certainly come in towards the harbor - a lot of nettles but the moon jellies have been thinned this year with his very few offshore today yeah me too just a few its nettles everywhere but not like that not like December the Sun not like the clouds oh yeah that's the year we grab Slater's legs and found out that not all iPhones are waterproof unless one of these active oh ring to new phone since when I jumped on the boat the first day went whale watching down a Newport or sat down and pushed you out the back pocket off that off the back of the zodiac and then I went kayaking like four months ago yeah and I went to pull the camera out oh it's stuck on the strap and there's a iPhone Tector somewhere off Lover's point yeah yeah but there's there's actually a few good resources for molla information I didn't run across a website called like ocean sunfish org I think that's Tierney's website yeah it's pretty good yeah check that out it has a lot of good information about the animals and also a little bit about that controversy you know starting since 2017 about if mola Ram ji and the other one are the same animal she's gonna make it Oh like a comprehensive textbook oh so she's a real politician colleges make a mola book yeah my leg might be in the book because she wants to do mullahs in pop culture then will you ask her if your leg is a mullet ektara mola yeah I'll ask her mola Ram ji it makes the book I'll ask her alright guys yeah so sorry for nerd fish nerding out and dinosaur nerding out that's okay we like fish and dinosaurs well it's gonna be dinosaurs - yeah some people think their photos Billy yes sure I've been hearing that one a lot this or that whales are fish well we saw a big fish like it's a mammal freezing well like other cultures they call whales big fish yeah yeah like in Chinese it's like Junu and that means big fish you know it's like means something fish I think in German porpoise is pig fish that's the translation is pig fish I don't speak - no speak Deutsch so yeah you know yeah see Jean is wet and like the other part is like ocean so it's like he speaks more Mandarin in me it's pretty alright well
